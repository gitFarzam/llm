Nutritional benefits of apples One small apple     g  contains approximately     kcal/    KJ  . g protein  . g fat   . g carbohydrates  . g fibre    mg potassium  mg vit C What are the   top health benefits of apples?  . May lower cholesterol Apples contain pectin  a natural fibre found in plants. Recent research by the European Journal of Nutrition found that eating pectin rich whole apples had a cholesterol lowering effect in healthy volunteers  compared to apple juice. A study by the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also showed that consuming around   g of dried apple  approximately two apples  helped to reduce cholesterol in postmenopausal women.  . May protect against diabetes Apples are low on the glycaemic index  GI  thanks to their fibre content. This  together with their high flavonoid content  may help to improve insulin sensitivity  which is important both for weight management and preventing diabetes.  . May prevent obesity Animal studies have shown that pectin extracted from apples may help regulate the gut microbiome  beneficial gut bacteria which in turn may help prevent obesity and other inflammatory disorders. Studies on humans also look promising  but more research is needed.  . May protect against heart disease Apples are rich in polyphenols  protective plant compounds  one of which is a flavonoid called quercetin. Research by the American Journal for Clinical Nutrition found that those with higher quercetin levels  mainly through eating apples  had a lower risk of several chronic diseases including heart disease and even asthma.  . May be beneficial for bone health Fruit and vegetable intake are thought to be associated with greater bone density and improved bone health. Findings from a study on healthy women suggested apples  in particular  may minimise the amount of calcium lost from the body and hence improve bone strength. Is it safe for everyone to eat apples? Apples  along with fruits including peaches  avocados and blueberries contain natural chemicals called salicylates. Some people are sensitive to these compounds and may experience an allergic reaction  including skin rash and swelling. Some consumers  who are concerned about pesticides  may opt for organically grown apples.

Apples are a widely consumed  rich source of phytochemicals  and epidemiological studies have linked the consumption of apples with reduced risk of some cancers  cardiovascular disease  asthma  and diabetes. In the laboratory  apples have been found to have very strong antioxidant activity  inhibit cancer cell proliferation  decrease lipid oxidation  and lower cholesterol. Apples contain a variety of phytochemicals  including quercetin  catechin  phloridzin and chlorogenic acid  all of which are strong antioxidants. The phytochemical composition of apples varies greatly between different varieties of apples  and there are also small changes in phytochemicals during the maturation and ripening of the fruit. Storage has little to no effect on apple phytochemicals  but processing can greatly affect apple phytochemicals. While extensive research exists  a literature review of the health benefits of apples and their phytochemicals has not been compiled to summarize this work. The purpose of this paper is to review the most recent literature regarding the health benefits of apples and their phytochemicals  phytochemical bioavailability and antioxidant behavior  and the effects of variety  ripening  storage and processing on apple phytochemicals. Keywords  apples  antioxidants  phytochemicals  cancer  cardiovascular disease  phenolics  flavonoids  fruit Background In the United States  as well as in most industrialized countries  cardiovascular disease and cancer are ranked as the top two leading causes of death. The causes of both diseases have been linked to lifestyle choices  and one of the most important is diet. It has been estimated that a healthy diet could prevent approximately     of all cancers      . High cholesterol and obesity are greatly influenced by diet and lifestyle and are costing the United States billions of dollars in health related expenses. High cholesterol  a risk factor for cardiovascular disease  is commonly treated with statin drugs  and it has been estimated that the United States will spend    billion dollars per year on cholesterol treatment by statin drugs . In       obesity  a risk factor for cardiovascular disease  cancer  and diabetes  has been estimated to cost the United States over    billion dollars per year . Understanding the effects of diet on chronic disease may greatly aid in the prevention of chronic disease. As children  many of us were told to  eat your vegetables because they are good for you   and the adage  an apple a day keeps the doctor away  is still quite popular. Recently  many studies have provided the scientific backing for both of these very common phrases. In the early      s  researchers examined well over one hundred epidemiological studies relating to diet and cancer  and in     of     dietary studies  fruits and vegetables had a significant protective effect against a variety of different cancers . They found that those who consumed low amounts of fruits and vegetables were twice as likely to have cancer compared to those who ate high amounts of fruits and vegetables. Recently  a study linked intake of fruits and vegetables with a reduced risk in breast cancer in woman in China . In this population based  case control study of women in Shanghai  pre menopausal women who ate more dark yellow orange vegetables and more citrus fruits tended to have lower breast cancer risk. Fruit and vegetable intake also appears to have a protective effect against coronary heart disease . Approximately        women were followed for    years and        men were followed for   years. They found that people who ate the highest amount of fruits and vegetables had a     lower risk for coronary heart disease  and the lowest risks were seen in people who consumed more green leafy vegetables  and fruits rich in vitamin C. Not only may a diet high in fruits and vegetables help prevent heart disease and cancer  but it may also help protect against a variety of other illnesses. For example  a diet high in fruits and vegetables may help protect against cataracts  diabetes  Alzheimer disease  and even asthma       . Much of the protective effect of fruits and vegetables has been attributed to phytochemicals  which are the non nutrient plant compounds such as the carotenoids  flavonoids  isoflavonoids  and phenolic acids. Thousands of phytochemicals have been identified in foods  yet there are still many that have not been identified. Different phytochemicals have been found to possess a range of activities  which may help in protecting against chronic disease. For example  phytochemicals may inhibit cancer cell proliferation  regulate inflammatory and immune response  and protect against lipid oxidation        . A major role of the phytochemicals is protection against oxidation. We live in a highly oxidative environment  and many processes involved in metabolism may result in the production of more oxidants. Humans  and all animals  have complex antioxidant defense systems  but they are not perfect and oxidative damage will occur. Both cardiovascular disease and cancer are thought to be particularly the results of oxidative stress  which can lead to damage of the larger biomolecules  such as DNA  lipids  and proteins. It has been estimated that there are        oxidative hits to DNA per cell per day in humans . A major class of phytochemicals found commonly in fruits and vegetables are the flavonoids. Apples are a very significant source of flavonoids in people s diet in the US and in Europe. In the United States  twenty two percent of the phenolics consumed from fruits are from apples making them the largest source of phenolics . In Finland  apples and onions are main sources of dietary flavonoids  while in the Netherlands apples rank third behind tea and onions as top sources of flavonoids        . In a Finnish study of approximately        people  flavonoid intake was associated with a lower total mortality . Apples were one of the main sources of dietary flavonoids that showed the strongest associations with decreased mortality. Not only are apples commonly enjoyed by many cultures  but they are also a good source of antioxidants. When compared to many other commonly consumed fruits in the United States  apples had the second highest level of antioxidant activity  Figure ​  . Apples also ranked the second for total concentration of phenolic compounds  and perhaps more importantly  apples had the highest portion of free phenolics when compared to other fruits . This means that these compounds are not bound to other compounds in the fruits  and the phenolics may be more available for eventual absorption into the bloodstream. An external file that holds a picture  illustration  etc. Object name is                .jpg Figure   Antioxidant activity of various fruit extracts  mean ± SD  n   . Since fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants  a diet high in these foods should help prevent oxidative stress  and may therefore help prevent chronic disease and slow aging. These findings have lead to the National Research Council to recommend consuming five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Several commonly consumed foods and beverages  including tea  wine  onions  cocoa  cranberries  and apples  have been targeted as particularly beneficial in the diet because of their high content of phenolic compounds. While active research into the health benefits of these foods has been ongoing  current reviews of this work exist for all of the above mentioned foods except apples. Therefore  the purpose of this paper is to review the recent literature addressing the health benefits of apples  their phytochemical profile  bioavailability of apple phytochemicals  and factors that may affect the phytochemical quality  such as apple variety  ripening  storage  and processing. Health benefits of apples  epidemiological evidence Cancer Several studies have specifically linked apple consumption with a reduced risk for cancer  especially lung cancer. In the Nurses  Health Study and the Health Professionals  Follow up Study  involving over        women and         men  fruit and vegetable intake was associated with a     reduced risk in lung cancer risk in women  but this association was not seen in men . Very few of the individual fruits and vegetables examined had a significant effect on lung cancer risk in women  however apples were one of the individual fruits associated with a decreased risk in lung cancer. Women who consumed at least one serving per day of apples and pears had a reduced risk of lung cancer . Of the men involved  there was no association seen between any individual fruit or vegetable and lung cancer risk. In a case control study in Hawaii  it was found that apple and onion intake was associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer in both males and females . Smoking history and food intake was assessed for     patients with lung cancer and     control subjects without lung cancer. There was a   –    decreased risk in lung cancer in participants with the highest intake of apples  onions  and white grapefruit when compared to those who consumed the lowest amount of these fruits. The decreased risk in lung cancer was seen in both men and women and in almost all ethnic groups. No associations were seen with red wine  black tea or green tea. Both onions and apples are high in flavonoids  especially quercetin and quercetin conjugates . Le Marchand et al. found an inverse association between lung cancer and quercetin intake although the trend was not statistically significant. Interestingly  the inverse association seen between apple and onion intake and lung cancer were stronger for squamous cell carcinomas than for adenocarcinomas. In a Finnish study involving        men and women and a    year follow up  a strong inverse association was seen between flavonoid intake and lung cancer development . In the sampled population  the mean flavonoid intake was  .  mg per day  and     of the total flavonoid intake was quercetin. Apples and onions together provided     of all flavonoid intake. The reduced risk of lung cancer associated with increased flavonoid consumption was especially strong in younger people and in nonsmokers. Apples were the only specific foods that were inversely related to lung cancer risk. Since apples were the main source of flavonoids in the Finnish population  it was concluded that the flavonoids from apples were most likely responsible for the decreased risk in lung cancer. The relationship of dietary catechins and epithelial cancer was examined in     men  aged   –    as part of the Zutphen Elderly Study . Tea  a naturally high source of catechins  contributed     of the total catechin intake in this study  while apples contributed  .   of catechin consumption. It was found that total catechin and tea consumption did not have an effect on lung cancer  but apple consumption was associated with decreased epithelial lung cancer incidence . This supported the findings of the previous studies discussed  where apples were significantly inversely associated with lung cancer  and may suggest that catechins alone do not play have a effect against lung cancers. Other data from the Zutphen Elderly study showed an inverse association between fruit and vegetable flavonoids and total cancer incidence and tumors of the alimentary and respiratory tract . Again  tea flavonoids were not associated with a decrease in cancer risk. Cardiovascular disease A reduced risk of cardiovascular disease has been associated with apple consumption. The Women s Health Study surveyed nearly        women with a  .  year follow up  and examined the association between flavonoids and cardiovascular disease . Women ingesting the highest amounts of flavonoids had a     reduction in risk of cardiovascular events. Flavonoid intake was not associated with risk of stroke  myocardial infarction  or cardiovascular disease death. Quercetin did not have any association with cardiovascular disease  cardiovascular events  myocardial infarction or stroke. However  both apple intake and broccoli intake were associated with reductions in the risk of both cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events. Women ingesting apples had a   –    decrease in cardiovascular disease risk. In a Finnish study examining flavonoid intake and coronary mortality  it was found that total flavonoid intake was significantly inversely associated with coronary mortality in women  but not in men . Apple and onion intake was also inversely associated with coronary mortality  especially in women. Data collected from this same cohort study also showed the effect of quercetin and apple intake on cerebrovascular disease . Those who had the highest consumption of apples had a lower risk of thrombotic stroke compared to those who consumed the lowest amounts of apples . Onion intake and quercetin intake were not associated with thrombotic stroke or other cerebrovascular diseases. Apple and wine consumption was also inversely associated with death from coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women in a study of nearly        women in Iowa . The intakes of catechin and epicatechin  both constituents of apples  were strongly inversely associated with coronary heart disease death. Although total catechin intake was inversely associated with coronary heart disease mortality  Arts et al        found that tea catechins were not associated with coronary heart disease mortality in postmenopausal women. Apple catechins may be more bioavailable than the catechin and epicatechin gallates commonly found in teas. The relationship between flavonoids and risk of coronary heart disease were also examined as part of the Zutphen Elderly Study . Flavonoid intake was strongly correlated with a decreased mortality from heart disease in elderly men and also negatively correlated with myocardial infarction. Tea was the main source of flavonoids in this study and was also negatively correlated with coronary heart disease. Apple intake contributed to approximately     of the total ingested flavonoids and was also associated with a reduced risk of death from coronary heart disease in men  however the relationship was not statistically significant . Asthma and pulmonary function Apple consumption has been inversely linked with asthma and has also been positively associated with general pulmonary health. In a recent study involving      adults in Australia  apple and pear intake was associated with a decreased risk of asthma and a decrease in bronchial hypersensitivity  but total fruit and vegetable intake was not associated with asthma risk or severity . Specific antioxidants  such as vitamin E  vitamin C  retinol  and β carotene  were not associated with asthma or bronchial hypersensitivity. Previously it had been found that apple intake  as well as selenium intake  was associated with less asthma in adults in the United Kingdom . This study surveyed nearly     individuals with asthma and     individuals without asthma about their diet and lifestyle. Total fruit and vegetable intake was weakly associated with asthma  and apple intake showed a stronger inverse relationship with asthma. This latter effect was most clear in subjects who consumed at least two apples per week. Onion  tea  and red wine consumption were not related to asthma incidence  suggesting an especially beneficial effect of apple flavonoids. Vitamin C and vitamin E were not correlated with asthma incidence  and carotene intake was weakly  but positively  associated with asthma. Apple intake and orange intake were both associated with a reduced incidence of asthma in the Finnish study involving         men and women . Flavonoid intake in general was associated with a lower risk of asthma  and the association was attributed mainly to quercetin  hesperitin  and naringenin. Other fruits and vegetables  such as onions  grapefruit  white cabbage  and juices  were not associated with a decreased risk in asthma. In a study of over        adults in the Netherlands  it was found that apples might beneficially affect lung function . Apple and pear intake was positively associated with pulmonary function and negatively associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Catechin intake was also associated with pulmonary function and negatively associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  but there was no association between tea  the main source of catechins  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . A study of approximately      middle aged    –   yrs  Welsh men also demonstrated a beneficial effect of apple consumption on lung function . Lung function was measured as forced expiratory volume  FEV  in one second  and was positively correlated with citrus fruit  fruit juice/squash  and apple consumption. However  the association with citrus fruit and fruit juice/squash lost significance after adjustment for smoking. Apple consumption remained positively correlated with lung function after taking into account possible confounders such as smoking  body mass index  social class  and exercise. Participants who consumed five or more apples per week had a significantly greater FEV of     mL when compared to those who did not consume apples . Diabetes and weight loss Not only may apples help decrease the risk of heart disease  cancer  and asthma  but apple consumption may also be associated with a lower risk for diabetes. In the previously discussed Finnish study of        people  a reduced risk of Type II diabetes was associated with apple consumption . Higher quercetin intake  a major component of apple peels  was also associated with a decreased risk in type II diabetes. Myrectin and berry intake were also associated with a decreased risk in type II diabetes  but onion  orange  grapefruit and white cabbage intake were not associated with a lowered risk. Apple and pear intake has also been associated with weight loss in middle aged overweight women in Brazil . Approximately     hypercholestemic  but nonsmoking  women were randomized to one of three supplement groups  oat cookies  apples or pears  and each subject consumed one of each supplement three times per day for twelve weeks. The participants who consumed either of the fruits had a significant weight loss after    weeks of  .   kg  whereas those consuming the oat cookies did not have a significant weight loss. Those consuming fruit also had a significantly lower blood glucose level when compared to those consuming the oat cookies . Summary Based on these epidemiological studies  it appears that apples may play a large role in reducing the risk of a wide variety of chronic disease and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in general. Of the papers reviewed  apples were most consistently associated with reduced risk of cancer  heart disease  asthma  and type II diabetes when compared to other fruits and vegetables and other sources of flavonoids. Apple consumption was also positively associated with increased lung function and increased weight loss. Partially because of such strong epidemiological evidence supporting the health benefits in apples  there is increasing research using animal and in vitro models that attempts to more clearly explain these health benefits. Health benefits and apples  animal and in vitro studies Antioxidant activity Apples  and especially apple peels  have been found to have a potent antioxidant activity and can greatly inhibit the growth of liver cancer and colon cancer cells        . The total antioxidant activity of apples with the peel was approximately    μmol vitamin C equivalents  which means that the antioxidant activity of     g apples  about one serving of apple  is equivalent to about      mg of vitamin C. However  the amount of vitamin C in     g of apples is only about  .  mg . Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant  but this research shows that nearly all of the antioxidant activity from apples comes from a variety of other compounds. Vitamin C in apples contributed less than  .   of total antioxidant activity. Antiproliferative activity Apples have been shown to have potent antiproliferative activity in several studies. When Caco   colon cancer cells were treated with apple extracts  cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner reaching a maximum inhibition of     at a dose of    mg/mL. The same trend was seen in Hep G  liver cancer cells with maximal inhibition reaching     at a dose of    mg/mL . Eberhardt et al. proposed that it is the unique combination of phytochemicals in the apples that are responsible for inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. Apples had the third highest antiproliferative activity when compared to eleven other commonly consumed fruits . Different varieties of apples had different effects on liver cancer cell proliferation . At a dose of    mg/mL  Fuji apple extracts inhibited Hep G  cell proliferation by     and Red Delicious extracts inhibited cell proliferation by    . Northern Spy apples had no effect on cell proliferation . Apples without peels were significantly less effective in inhibiting Hep G  cell proliferation when compared to apples with the peel  suggesting that apple peels possess significant antiproliferative activity. Wolfe et al. demonstrated that apple peels alone inhibited Hep G  cell proliferation significantly more than whole apples. For example  apple peels from Idared apples had an EC   of   .  mg/mL whereas the whole apple had an EC   of    .  mg/mL. The EC   refers to the dose of the apple that is required to inhibit cell proliferation by    . There has been some concern that apple antioxidants do not directly inhibit tumor cell proliferation  but instead they indirectly inhibit cell proliferation by generating H O  in reaction with the cell culture media . However  more recently it has been reported that apple extracts did not generate H O  formation in WME  DMEM  or DMEM/Ham F   media  and H O  addition to culture medium did not inhibit Hep G  cell proliferation or Caco   colon cancer cell proliferation . Additionally  the addition of catalase did not block the antiproliferative activity of apple extracts. Inhibition of lipid oxidation Addition of apple phenolics to human serum decreased diphenylhexatriene labeled phosphatidylcholine  DPHPC  oxidation in a dose dependent manner . DPHPC is incorporated into low density lipoprotein  LDL high density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein  VLDL  fractions and is an indicator of oxidation. Apple ingestion led to a decrease in DPHPC oxidation  reflecting the apples antioxidant activity in vivo . The protective effects of apples on LDL oxidation reached its peak at three hours following apple consumption and returned to baseline levels by    hours . Diphenylhexatriene labeled propionic acid  DPHPA  binds to serum albumin and is a good measure of oxidation within the aqueous phase of human serum. Mayer et al.        also found that consumption of apples also led to a decrease in albumin DPHPA oxidation  reaching peak activity at   hours. Although apple juice typically contains less phenolics than whole apples  it is still a widely consumed source of dietary antioxidants. Pearson et al examined the effects of six commercial apple juices and Red Delicious apples  whole apples  peels alone  and flesh alone  on human LDL oxidation in vitro. LDL oxidation was measured using headspace analysis of hexanal produced from copper induced lipid oxidation in vitro. The dose of the apple juices and whole apple  apple peel and apple flesh  were standardized for gallic acid equivalents  and each LDL solution was treated with   μM gallic acid equivalents for each apple sample. LDL oxidation inhibition varied greatly between brands of fruit juice  ranging from   to     inhibition and whole apples inhibited LDL oxidation by    . Apple peels inhibited LDL oxidation by    while the flesh alone showed significantly less inhibition     . Rats fed apple juice also had a decreased level of malondialdehyde  MDA a marker of lipid peroxidation . Quercetin  a major flavonoid in apples  had no effect on lipid oxidation when ingested by rats  suggesting that quercetin alone is not responsible for the apple s ability to inhibit lipid oxidation . Other antioxidants and the interaction between the different apple antioxidants  including quercetin  may contribute to the antioxidant activity of apples. The effect of apple juice on lipid oxidation has also been examined in vivo in human subjects. In a study involving four women and one man  ingestion of high levels of a     mixture of apple juice and black currant juice increased the antioxidant status of the blood and decreased lipid oxidation . Glutathione peroxidase also increased in humans consuming apple juice. Plasma MDA decreased over the seven day intervention period when the subjects ingested the highest dose of the apple juice and black currant mixture       mL . Despite the antioxidant effect on lipoproteins  apple juice intake had a pro oxidant effect on plasma proteins in both humans and rats        . Cholesterol lowering effects Some of the apple s protective effect against cardiovascular disease may come from its potential cholesterol lowering ability. Aprikian et al.        found that when cholesterol fed rats were supplemented with lyophilized apples  there was a significant drop in plasma cholesterol and liver cholesterols and an increase in high density lipoproteins  HDL . Furthermore  they found that cholesterol excretion increased in the feces of rats fed apples  suggesting reduced cholesterol absorption . In a second study  a similar cholesterol lowering effect was seen in cholesterol fed rats when rats were fed apples  pears  and peaches. Apples had a greater cholesterol lowering affect than the other two fruits . The three fruits also increased the plasma antioxidant potential  with apple having the greatest effect . Apples  pears  and peaches all had similar fiber content  but apples contained more phenolic compounds suggesting that perhaps the phenolics in apples contribute to this effect . In obese Zucker rats  apple consumption lowered cholesterol and low density lipoproteins  LDL however in lean rats  apple consumption did not change cholesterol levels . In rats supplemented with cholesterol  apple pomace fiber and sugar beet fiber  the plasma lipids were significantly lower than in rats without the dietary fiber . Rats fed sugar beet pulp fiber and apple pomace fiber  but not fed cholesterol  had no change in lipids  suggesting that these sources of dietary fiber have hypolipidemic effects only in rats fed cholesterol . The sugar beet pulp fiber and the apple pomace fiber did not have an effect of lipid peroxides. Aprikian et al. in more recent studies  found that combined apple pectin and apple phenolic fractions lowered plasma and liver cholesterol  triglycerides  and apparent cholesterol absorption to a much greater extent than either apple pectin alone or apple phenolics alone . This work suggests that there is a beneficial interaction between fruit fiber and polyphenolic components and also supports the benefits of eating whole fruits as opposed to dietary supplements. Other health effects Aside from chronic disease  apples may be used to help combat other prevalent disease in the world. Recently it has been found that crude extracts from immature apples actually inhibited enzymatic activities of cholera toxin in a dose dependent manner . Additionally  apple extract reduced cholera toxin induced fluid accumulation in a dose dependent manner . The apple extracts were fractionated and each fraction was tested for inhibitory action on enzymatic activities of cholera toxin. The two apple extract fractions that contained highly polymerized catechins inhibited cholera toxin catalyzed ADP ribosylation by     and    . The fraction containing non catechin polyphenols caused only  .   inhibition and the fraction containing monomeric  dimeric  and trimeric catechins caused     inhibition . Summary Overall  the animal studies and in vitro work begin to define mechanisms by which apples may help prevent chronic disease. First  the strong antioxidant activity of apples may help prevent lipid and DNA oxidation. Cancer cell culture work has demonstrated that apples inhibit cell proliferation in vitro  which may contribute to the association of apple intake with decreased cancer risk. Apples significantly lowered lipid oxidation both in humans and rats and lowered cholesterol in humans. These effects  which may be attributed to both the phenolics and the dietary fiber found in apples  may partially explain the inverse association of apple intake and risk of cardiovascular disease. Apple phytochemicals Apples contain a large concentration of flavonoids  as well as a variety of other phytochemicals  and the concentration of these phytochemicals may depend on many factors  such as cultivar of the apple  harvest and storage of the apples  and processing of the apples. The concentration of phytochemicals also varies greatly between the apple peels and the apple flesh. Some of the most well studied antioxidant compounds in apples include quercetin   galactoside  quercetin   glucoside  quercetin   rhamnoside  catechin  epicatechin  procyanidin  cyanidin   galactoside  coumaric acid  chlorogenic acid  gallic acid  and phloridzin  Figure ​  . Recently researchers have examined the average concentrations of the major phenolic compounds in six cultivars of apples. They found that the average phenolic concentrations among the six cultivars were  quercetin glycosides    .  mg/    g fruit  vitamin C    .  mg/    g fruit  procyanidin B   .   mg/    g fruit  chlorogenic acid   .   mg/    g fruit  epicatechin   .   mg/    g fruit  and phloretin glycosides   .   mg/    g fruit . An external file that holds a picture  illustration  etc. Object name is                .jpg Figure   Structures of selected apple antioxidants. The compounds most commonly found in apple peels consist of the procyanidins  catechin  epicatechin  chlorogenic acid  phloridzin  and the quercetin conjugates. In the apple flesh  there is some catechin  procyanidin  epicatechin  and phloridzin  but these compounds are found in much lower concentrations than in the peels. Quercetin conjugates are found exclusively in the peel of the apples. Chlorogenic acid tends to be higher in the flesh than in the peel . Because the apple peels contain more antioxidant compounds  especially quercetin  apple peels may have higher antioxidant activity and higher bioactivity than the apple flesh. Research showed that apples without the peels had less antioxidant activity than apples with the peels. Apples with the peels were also better able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation when compared to apples without the peels . More recent work has shown that apple peels contain anywhere from two to six times  depending on the variety  more phenolic compounds than in the flesh  and two to three times more flavonoids in the peels when compared to the flesh. The antioxidant activity of these peels was also much greater  ranging from two to six times greater in the peels when compared to the flesh  depending on the variety of the apple . This work is supported by Leontowicz et al who found that rats consuming apple peels showed greater inhibition of lipid peroxidation and greater plasma antioxidant capacity when compared to rats fed apple flesh. Many of these phytochemicals from apples have been widely studied  and many potential health benefits have been attributed to these specific phytochemicals. The procyanidins  epicatechin and catechin  have strong antioxidant activity and have been found to inhibit low density lipoprotein  LDL  oxidation in vitro . In mice  catechin inhibits intestinal tumor formation and delays tumors onset        . Sawa et al.        found that chlorogenic acid has very high alkyl peroxyl radical  ROO scavenging activity. Compared to about    other antioxidant compounds  including quercetin  gallic acid  α tocopherol chlorogenic was second only to rutin . Since ROO  may enhance tumor promotion and carcinogenesis  chlorogenic acid may add to the protective effect of apples against cancer. Chlorogenic acid has been found to inhibit   dehydroxy deoxyguanosine formation in cellular DNA in a rat model following treatment with   nitroquinoline   oxide . Quercetin is also a strong antioxidant  and is thought to have potential protective effects against both cancer and heart disease. Briefly  quercetin has been found to down regulate expression of mutant p   in breast cancer cells  arrest human leukemic T cells in G   inhibit tyrosine kinase  and inhibit heat shock proteins . Quercetin has protected Caco   cells from lipid peroxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide and Fe   . In mice liver treated with ethanol  quercetin decreased lipid oxidation and increased glutathione  protecting the liver from oxidative damage . Recently  it has been found that high doses of quercetin inhibit cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cell lines and in mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines  but at low doses quercetin increased cell proliferation      in colon cancer cells and      in breast cancer cells  . However  low doses of quercetin     uM  inhibited cell proliferation in Mol   Human Leukemia cells and also induced apoptosis . Quercetin inhibited intestinal tumor growth in mice  but not in rats. Low levels of quercetin inhibited platelet aggregation  calcium mobilization  and tyrosine protein phosphorylation in platelets . Modulation of platelet activity may help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both animal and cell culture studies show that there is an association between the polyphenolic compounds found within apples and a wide variety of effects that may help prevent chronic disease. This supports the hypothesis that it is the phytochemicals found in fruits  especially apples  that impart healthy benefits. More research is still needed to clarify the effects of these compounds in vivo. In order to examine the effects of these compounds in vivo  it is necessary to understand the bioavailability of the specific compounds  and the bioavailability of these compounds within the fruit matrix. Bioavailability of phytochemicals As the link between diet and chronic disease grows stronger  many are working to understand how phytochemicals may provide health benefits. An important question to be asked is  Are these phytochemicals bioavailable? Concentrations and bioavailability of phytochemicals are important issues to evaluate when characterizing the effects of dietary phytochemicals on human health. To this date  little literature exists that addresses the bioavailability of phytochemicals from whole foods  including the apple. One of the few studies addressing bioavailability from apples or apple products looks at the bioavailability of polyphenolic compounds from alcoholic apple cider in humans . After drinking  .  liters of apple cider  no quercetin was found in the volunteers  plasma. Instead  low levels of    methyl quercetin and    methyl quercetin were seen within    minutes following consumption of the cider. Caffeic acid was rapidly absorbed  but within    minutes the caffeic levels in the plasma were undetectable. Catechin  epicatechin  and phlorizin were not seen in the plasma  possibly because the concentration in the cider was too low. Hippuric acid and phloretin were both increased in the subjects  urine following the consumption of the cider  but there was no evidence of quercetin  catechin  or epicatechin in the urine . In another study involving human subjects  quercetin bioavailability from apples was only     of the bioavailability of quercetin from onions . In this study  quercetin levels reached a peak after  .  hours in the plasma  however the compounds were hydrolyzed prior to analysis  so the extent of quercetin conjugation in the plasma is unknown. The bioavailability differences between apples and onions most likely are from the differences in quercetin conjugates in the different foods. Onions contain more quercetin aglycone and more quercetin glucosides  whereas apples tend to contain more quercetin monoglycosides and quercetin rutinoside  which may be less bioavailable. Our lab has examined the bioavailability of both quercetin and quercetin   glucoside from apple peel extracts and onion extracts in Caco   cells. Apple peel extracts contained no free quercetin  and no quercetin accumulation was seen in the Caco   cells following incubation with apple peel extract. Low amounts of quercetin   glucoside were absorbed by the cells     . However  onions contain some free quercetin and greater amounts of quercetin glucosides  and the absorption of quercetin into the Caco   cells from onion extracts was much greater than from apple extracts. The above results can be explained by recent research examining quercetin and quercetin glycoside bioavailability. In a study by Walle et al. it was found that  in the ileostomy fluid  quercetin primarily existed as the aglycone form. The group hypothesized that β glucosidases hydrolyzed quercetin glucosides to quercetin  which could be then passively transported . In support of this theory  Day et al. determined that quercetin glycosides were mainly deglycosylated by lactase phlorizin hydrolase before the aglycone then passed into the cell. Some intact glycoside transport by SGLT  occurred and the glucosides were deglycosylated within the cell by cytosolic β glucosidase. Quercetin   glucoside appeared to utilize only the lactase phlorizin hydrolase pathway  not the SLGT  transporter  but quercetin   glucoside used both pathways . Apples contain some quercetin   glucoside that  following hydrolysis by LPH  would be available for uptake by intestinal cells. However  apples also contain other conjugates such as quercetin rhamnosides  quercetin xylosides  and quercetin galactosides that are not easily hydrolyzed by lactase phlorizin hydrolase  and most likely are not readily absorbed by small intestinal cells. In comparison  the quercetin in onions is almost all in the form of quercetin glucosides and free quercetin  making it more bioavailable to small intestinal cells. Some bacterial degradation of quercetin conjugates most likely occurs in the human intestinal tract. Enterococcus casseliflavis and Eubacterium ramulus  microorganisms isolated from human feces  were both found to degrade quercetin   glucoside as a carbon and energy source . Enterococcus casseliflavis utilized only the sugar moiety of the glucoside  whereas Eubacterium ramulus was also capable of degrading the aromatic ring system with phloroglucinol produced as an intermediate . Phloridzin  the glucoside conjugate of phloretin  is the major dihydrochalcone found in apples. Similarly to quercetin glucosides  phloridzin is thought to be hydrolyzed by lactase phloridzin hydrolase  and phloretin aglycone is taken up by the intestinal cells. When rats were fed phloridzin and phloretin  their plasma contained glucuronidated and sulfated phloretin but no phloridzin . This supports the theory that phloridzin is hydrolyzed prior to uptake and further glucuronidation by intestinal epithelial cells. Phloridzin is known to be a potent SGLT  inhibitor  but recently it has been discovered that phloridzin is also transported by SGLT  . However  phloridzin  as well as other flavonoid glucosides such as quercetin glucoside  is also effluxed by the multi drug resistance protein  MRP   . In human ileostomy subjects  chlorogenic acid absorption was approximately    and only traces of chlorogenic acid was found in the urine . The majority of chlorogenic acid will reach the large intestine and may be metabolized by the gut microflora. Gonthier et al        found that rats fed chlorogenic acid excrete very little chlorogenic acid in their urine  but instead they excrete mainly microbial produced metabolites of chlorogenic acid  such as hippuric acid and m coumaric acid . A more recent study by Olthof et al        involving human subjects showed that half of the ingested chlorogenic acid was converted to hippuric acid in the colon  most likely by microbial metabolism . Catechin and epicatechin are both absorbed by small intestinal epithelial cells . In contrast to quercetin  epicatechin was not glucuronidated by human liver microsomes  nor was it glucuronidated by human small intestinal or large intestinal tissue . Both liver and intestinal tissues contain UDP glucuronosyltransferases  UGT  that are involved in the glucuronidation of various other flavonoids. Epicatechin was found to be sulfated by the human liver and intestinal cytosols  indicating that sulfation is the major metabolic pathway for epicatechin metabolism . The mechanisms concerning the bioavailability of specific apple phytochemicals are becoming clearer as bioavailability research increases. In general  many flavonoid aglycones tend to pass through the intestinal epithelial cells where they are further conjugated. The flavonoid glycosides may be absorbed in small amounts  but most absorption seems to occur following hydrolysis by intestinal hydrolases such as lactase phloridzin hydrolase. Upon absorption these compounds are also conjugated. More research is still needed to understand the bioavailability of compounds from whole foods. The effects of the food matrix  interactions between compounds  digestion and processing on bioavailability of apple phytochemicals are still unknown. Effects of variety and ripening on apple phytochemicals Varietal differences Researchers in our lab have found distinct differences in total phenolic and total flavonoid content between different apple varieties. Of four common varieties used for applesauce  Rome Beauty  Idared  Cortland  and Golden Delicious Rome Beauty had the highest phenolic content while Cortland apples had the lowest . Rome Beauty apples also had the highest flavonoid content while Cortland apples had the lowest. However  Idared contained much higher anthocyanins than any of the other varieties . Anthocyanins are the antioxidant compounds in the fruits that may give fruit a red or blue color. Out of    varieties commonly consumed in the US  Fuji apples had the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid compounds  Figures ​  and ​  . Red Delicious apples were also quite high  and the apples containing the lowest amounts of phenolics and flavonoids were the Empire apples and the NY    apple. Antioxidant activity of apples also differs between different varieties  and was positively associated with the level of total phenolic content. The apple varieties with the higher phenolics tended to have higher antioxidant activity. An external file that holds a picture  illustration  etc. Object name is                .jpg Figure   Total phenolic content of apple varieties  mean ± SD  n   . An external file that holds a picture  illustration  etc. Object name is                .jpg Figure   Total flavonoid content of apple varieties  mean ± SD  n   . Researchers have found similar variations in phytochemical content between different cultivars of apples. Van der Sluis et al        found that Jonagold apples contained the highest concentration of quercetin glycosides  catechins  and chlorogenic acid when compared to Golden Delicious  Cox s Orange  and Elstar apples. Golden Delicious had the second highest concentration  while Cox s Orange and Elstar had the lowest concentrations . Escarpa and Gonzalez        found that Golden Delicious had the lowest concentration of flavonoids when compared to Reinata  Red Delicious  and Granny Smith apples. Reinata had the highest level of flavonoids  followed by Granny Smith and Red Delicious varieties. Another group looked solely at procyanidin content of four varieties of apples and found that Granny Smith and Red Delicious had the highest procyanidins while McIntosh and Golden Delicious had the lowest . Growth conditions Besides variety of apple  factors such as development and ripening of the fruits may impact phytochemical profiles in apples. Quercetin glycosides  phloridzin  catechins  and chlorogenic acid concentrations in Jonagold and Elstar apples were highest early in the season  and decreased to a steady level during maturation and ripening . Anthocyanins in Elstar and Jonagold apples started high and decreased in mid season  but rose rapidly just prior to maturation. Interestingly  this increase in anthocyanin content occurred only in fruits grown in the outer part of the canopy  and not in those grown in the inner part of the canopy. The amounts of quercetin glycosides in both Jonagold and Elstar were also greater in fruit grown in the outer canopy . Awad        also found that sun exposed fruits  both Jonagold and Elstar  had greater levels of anthocyanins and quercetin glycosides when compared to the shaded fruits  giving more evidence that exposure to sunlight affects these two compounds production . In general  it can be concluded that improving light exposure for apples may help increase the production of certain phytochemicals. There was no sunlight effect on phloridzin  catechin  and chlorogenic acid. Plant nutrition The effect of different nutrients on flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in apples has also been examined. Awad        found that nitrogen fertilization was associated with decreases in anthocyanins  catechins and total flavonoids  and also with decreased percentage of blush in the fruit peels. In Elstar apples  calcium fertilization was associated with an increase in anthocyanins and total flavonoids . They also examined the effects of applications of different chemicals that may enhance ripening on the formation of different phytochemicals. Ethephon increased anthocyanin production  but did not increase chlorogenic acid or any of the other phytochemicals studied. Gibberellins and  s  trans   amino      aminoethoxy    butenoic acid hydrochloride  ABG       both decreased anthocyanin production  but did not have an effect on other compounds studied. The application of other chemicals  such as alar  cycocel  seniphos  shikimic acid  plantacur E and galactose did not have an effect on any of the phytochemicals examined        . Effects of storage and processing on apple phytochemicals storage Apple phytochemical content is not greatly affected by storage. Quercetin glycosides  phloridzin  and anthocyanin content of Jonagold  Golden Delicious  Red Delicious  Elstar  and Cox s Orange apples were not affected by    weeks of storage in controlled atmospheric conditions. Chlorogenic acid and total catechins decreased slightly in Jonagold apples. Total catechin concentration decreased slightly in Golden Delicious  but chlorogenic acid concentrations remained stable . After    weeks of cold storage  there was no decrease in chlorogenic acid in any variety of apple  but catechin content decreased slightly in Golden Delicious  Elstar  and Cox s Orange apples. Both types of storage had no effect on antioxidant activity in any variety of apple examined. Another group looked specifically at the effects of storage on apple peel phenolics and found that storage at  °C for   months had little effect on phenolic content . Lattanzio et al.        found that after    days of cold storage the concentration of total phenolics in the skin of Golden Delicious apples increased. After     days  the total phenolics in the skin began to decrease  but even after     days in storage  the total phenolics were similar to those at the time of harvest . Processing Processing of apples has been found to affect phytochemical content. Apple juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight pressing had     of the antioxidant activity of fresh apples  while juice obtained after pulp enzyming had only    of antioxidant activity. After pulp enzyming  the juice contained     less phloridzin      less chlorogenic acid  and     less catechin. Most of the compounds remained in the apple pomace . Similarly  Guyot et al.        found that     of total phenolics were extracted in the juice  leaving over half the total phenolics in the apple pomace. They found that hydroxycinnamic acids and dihydrochalcones showed the greatest extraction yields in the juice      and    respectively. Procyanidins had the lowest yield in the juice     . Apple phenolics  especially procyanidins  have been found to bind with cell wall material  which could lead to the decreased levels of polyphenols found in apple juices . Apple pomace is a major waste product accumulated mainly during apple juice processing. Phloridzin  chlorogenic acid  epicatechin  and quercetin glucosides have all been isolated from apple pomace . These phenolics isolated from apple pomace have been found to have high antioxidant activity suggesting that apple pomace may have dietary health benefits and commercial use . Millions of pounds of waste apple peels are generated in the production of applesauce and canned apples in New York State each year. Since apple peels contain a majority of the antioxidants when compared to the flesh apple peels have the potential to be a value added ingredient in food products. Apple peels were blanched and then dried under a variety of conditions  oven dried at a range of temperatures between   ° and   °  air dried  or freeze dried . The freeze dried samples had the greatest total phenolic and flavonoid content  and the total phenolic and flavonoid was actually greater than in the fresh peels. The apple peel powder had strong antioxidant activity and also greatly inhibited cancer cell proliferation . Conclusion In numerous epidemiological studies  apples have been associated with a decreased risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease  cancer  and asthma. In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that apples have high antioxidant activity  can inhibit cancer cell proliferation  decrease lipid oxidation  and lower cholesterol  potentially explaining their role in reducing risk of chronic disease. Apples contain a wide variety of phytochemicals  many of which have been found to have strong antioxidant activity and anticancer activity. The interaction of the many apple phytochemicals warrants more study as researchers attempt to further explain the mechanism behind the apple s ability to reduce risk of chronic disease. Recent research has shown that apples do contain bioavailable phytochemicals  although more work is needed to better understand the bioavailability of phytochemicals within the apple matrix as opposed to pure phytochemicals. Many factors affect the phytochemical profile of apples  and are important to consider as one attempts to understand and maximize the health benefits of apples. Phytochemical concentrations vary greatly between different cultivars. The level of some phytochemicals varies during maturation of the fruits in response to available light  stage of fruit development and to some types of fertilization. In general  storage of apples does not seem to greatly affect apple phytochemicals  but the processing of apples for juice results in a very significant decrease in phenolics. Processed apple peels retain their phenolic and flavonoid compounds activity and therefore may be used as a value added ingredient with potent antioxidant activity. The potential health benefits of apples are numerous. Regular consumption of fruits and vegetables  including apples  as part of a healthy diet may aid in the prevention of chronic disease and maintenance of good health. Apple Nutrition — The Ultimate Gut   Heart Friendly Fruit Jillian Levy  CHHCSeptember         By Apple nutrition Dr. Axe Is an apple a day really good for you? You bet  thanks to all that apple nutrition has to offer. Did you know that apples and bananas are the most widely consumed fruits in the world? While berries usually get most of the credit when it comes to supplying antioxidants  apple nutrition is a close runner up. With a diverse family of phytonutrients  including polyphenols and carotenoids  present in apple pulp and skin  studies have linked their consumption with a reduced risk of many conditions. For example  health benefits associated with apples include protecting against constipation  types   diabetes  breast cancer and high cholesterol  as well as assisting in weight management. As one of best high fiber foods  specifically the type called pectin  they can help improve digestion and fill you up. Not too bad for one of the most widely available  easy to use fruits there is  Ad  Apple Nutrition Facts Apples are the fruit of the tree known as Malus domestica. Today  many different types are grown worldwide  but they first originated in Asia thousands of years ago. In fact  they are considered to be perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated by humans  What is the main nutrition found in apples? They’re are a good source of fiber  particularly the soluble  gelatinous polysaccharide called pectin that binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption. They also provide a surprising amount of antioxidants. Nutrition Facts  How many calories are in an apple? How many carbs does an apple have? One medium apple  about     grams  contains approximately  Calories      Total Carbohydrates    .  g Fiber   .  g Sugar    .  g Total Fat   .  g Saturated Fat   .  g Polyunsaturated Fat   .  g Monounsaturated Fat   .   g Trans Fat    g Protein   .  g Sodium    mg   .

Apple nutrition also provides some vitamin A  vitamin E  niacin  folate  pantothenic acid  choline  betaine  calcium  iron  magnesium and phosphorus. Apples vs. Other Fruits  Compared to apple nutrition  orange nutrition is higher in certain nutrients  including vitamin C  potassium  calcium and folate. Oranges are an an excellent source of vitamin C. They contain over     percent of your daily requirement in one orange compared to only    percent to    percent in one apple. Bananas are a high sugar and high starch fruit  but they actually have less sugar than apples     grams in a banana compared to    in an apple . Bananas are a lot higher in starch  but they also provide higher levels of some nutrients too. These include potassium  magnesium  vitamin C  folate and vitamin B . Both apples and pears are fruits in the Rosaceae plant family. They are believed to originate in Asia. Both are rich in dietary fiber  providing more than fruits like oranges and bananas. Apples are known for providing pectin  but pears are actually a better source of this special type of fiber. Both provide about     calories and have between   –   grams of sugar. What’s one of the best times to enjoy fruit? Before or after a workout. Fruit provides carbohydrates and can help enhance physical performance  concentration and stamina if you have a piece as a snack prior to hitting the gym. Health Benefits Many folklore remedies utilized apples in various ways  including to make vinegar  herbal teas and alcohol. Apples are said to have cooling  astringent properties that can help ease heartburn and a sour stomach. Thanks to their antioxidants and vitamin C  they have traditionally been used to help cleanse the mouth and teeth  prevent vitamin D deficiency  and fight constipation. Apples and their leaves have also been traditionally chewed and applied to the skin to treat inflammation  swelling  boils or infected bites. In Ayurvedic medicine  stewed/cooked apples are recommended to prevent constipation. Apples are considered helpful for balancing Kapha energy. In other words  they are thought to help relieve sluggishness  weight gain  blocked sinuses  allergies and colds. What are the benefits of eating apples  according to recent research?  . Great Source of Cancer Fighting Antioxidants Apples are a high antioxidant food and a very significant source of flavonoids. In the U.S.  it’s estimated that    percent of the phenolic antioxidants consumed from fruits are from apples  making them the largest single source of these compounds. Apples are ranked second to cranberries among all types of fruit for their total concentration of phenolic compounds. Research shows that beneficial antioxidants found in apple nutrition include  Ad  quercetin catechin phloridzin chlorogenic acid Because of these special compounds  apples do more than combat free radicals. They also have anti proliferative and beneficial cell signaling effects. In studies  anti inflammatory foods like apples are linked with the prevention of certain cancers  including prostate cancer and breast cancer  because of their supply of quercetin. Other evidence suggests that certain protective phytochemicals in the skin of apples can help inhibit the reproduction of cancer cells within the colon. What is the healthiest part of an apple? You want to eat the whole apple to get the most benefits  including the skin. When researchers studied the antioxidant capacity of pears and apples  they found that diets that included the fruit peels had a significantly higher level of healthy fatty acids  higher plasma lipid levels  and antioxidant activity than diets that discarded the peels and only ate the fruit’s pulp.  . Help Prevent Inflammation Phytochemicals found in colorful fruits  including phenolics  flavonoids and carotenoids  are known to reduce the risk for many chronic diseases that are widespread but largely preventable. This is because phytonutrients keep arteries clear  lower inflammatory responses and prevent high levels of oxidative stress. Among other fruits  apples are a part of the anti inflammatory diet known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension  DASH  diet  which is known to help improve cardiovascular function and lead to other benefits. Research from California State University suggests that high antioxidant foods are associated with “improved outcomes related to cognitive decline of normal aging  type   diabetes  weight management  bone health  pulmonary function  and gastrointestinal protection.”  . Fight Heart Disease Many studies show that people who consume more fresh plant foods filled with antioxidants experience lower inflammation and  therefore  have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The specific type of fiber found in apples  pectin  is especially known to be beneficial for lowering cholesterol levels naturally. Research suggests that interactions between fibers and polyphenols in apples together play an important role in markers of heart health and make it one of the top cholesterol lowering foods. A      study found that when rats were fed a diet high in apple pectin extract and freeze dried apples  they experienced significantly lower levels of cholesterol absorption and triglycerides than the control group. The group of rats receiving both apple pectin and the dried apples  instead of only one of these  experienced the most benefits in terms of intestine fermentations and lipid metabolism. One study that followed adults over a    year period found that  overall  a greater intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower risk of all cause death and cardiovascular disease. There’s also evidence that antioxidant rich fruits can play a role in preventing strokes  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  diverticulosis and hypertension. A      randomized  controlled study uncovered that eating two apples a day helped adults with high cholesterol improve cardiovascular health markers.  . High in Fiber Eating an apple is a great way to make sure you cover your bases of   –   grams daily. The fiber found in apples helps make you feel full and expands in your intestines  taking up volume. It’s also important for detoxification and supporting the digestive system because pectin regulates the body’s use of sugars and cholesterol.  . Improve Digestive Health Consuming plenty of fiber plus polyphenols has been shown to fight digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome  IBS  and even cancers of the digestive system. Higher fruit intake is correlated with better general digestive health  especially of the colon  stomach and bladder  because fruit’s nutrients can positively impact gut microbiota  contributing to healthy digestion and immune responses. The phytonutrients found in apples also protect the digestive organs from oxidative stress  alkalize the body and balance pH levels. When it comes to natural constipation relief  pectin in apples is considered a natural diuretic. It has mild laxative effects  helping combat bloating and water retention. Try either eating raw apples  remember to also eat the skin  or adding them to recipes by blending them first to help “stay regular.” An apple a day graphic Dr. Axe  . Good Source of Vitamin C One medium apple supplies about    percent of your daily vitamin C. Vitamin C is considered a powerful antioxidant that’s important for skin  eye  immune and brain health. Like other antioxidants we obtain through fresh vegetables and fruits  vitamin C fights free radical damage and helps protect DNA and cells from mutation and malformation. Research shows that vitamin C is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism and repairing tissue  especially in the eyes and skin. Vitamin C rich foods like apples have natural anti aging effects because they promote skin cell renewal  help heal wounds or cuts  guard against infections and harmful bacteria  and also block damage from UV light exposure.  . Can Help You Manage Your Weight Much research has shown that higher fruit and vegetable intake  including of apples  is linked with protection against obesity and weight gain. While apples provide high levels of important nutrients and antioxidants  they’re also low in calories since a high percentage of their volume is made up of water and fiber. Because they have a good dose of dietary fiber  which contains zero digestible calories and is useful for sustaining healthy blood sugar levels  apples can satisfy your sweet tooth without weighing you down or adding to food cravings. They’ve even been associated with better diet quality and reduced risk of obesity in children.  . May Help Fight Diabetes Wondering if the sugar in fruit bad for you? Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that eating five or more combined servings of fruits and vegetables daily significantly cut the risk of diabetes formation in adults. Certain flavonoids present in apples are known to improve insulin sensitivity. This is key to preventing both diabetes and long term weight gain. The other antioxidants and fiber found in apples also play a role in their anti diabetic effects. One study even concluded that “apple consumption before meals could improve postprandial hyperglycemia in normal subjects and those with impaired glucose tolerance.” Apples are considered a fruit that’s low on the glycemic index. Compared to refined carbohydrates or sweetened products  they have the ability to unleash sugar into the bloodstream at a slower rate  supporting normal insulin production.  . Help Fight Asthma Symptoms Interestingly  apples are shown to act like natural remedies for asthma. In fact  they are associated with general pulmonary health and reduced risk for bronchial hypersensitivity. In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition involving       adults in Australia  apple and pear intake was associated with a decreased risk of asthma and a decrease in bronchial hypersensitivity. The study surveyed nearly     individuals with asthma and     individuals without asthma about their diets and lifestyles. Total fruit and vegetable intake was found to be only weakly associated with asthma  but apple intake showed a stronger inverse relationship with asthma. The beneficial effect was most clear in subjects who consumed at least two apples per week. What’s also interesting is that this seems to be uniquely an apple nutrition benefit. Onion  tea and red wine consumption were not related to asthma incidence even though they also contain similar phytochemicals. This suggests that there are special interactions of apple flavonoids that help control asthma symptoms better than other antioxidants and nutrients. In addition  as research points out  “High consumption of fruits and vegetables was found to be associated with reduced risk of developing asthma in children and adults. This has been noted specifically for apples and oranges.”   . High Source of Boron Here’s a little known fact about apples  They are one of the best natural sources of boron. Boron is a mineral that is important for building strong bones and helping prevent osteoporosis. Boron uses and benefits include helping develop sex hormones  building muscle mass and supporting brain function. Some evidence also shows that low boron intake might be associated with fatigue  arthritis and mood changes.   . May Help Prevent Arthritis As it turns out  the polyphenols in apple nutrition can be useful in combating arthritis. A      study out of Japan examined the effects of this fruit’s polyphenols on the progression of osteoarthritis on rats. Researchers found that the apple polyphenols “enhanced cell proliferation and hyaluronan production. This indicates that AP may improve synovial conditions in OA and suppress OA progression. These effects may be attributed to the antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties of  apple polyphenols.” Other research has found that dietary fruit intake  including apples  “demonstrates a protective role of fruits and their polyphenols in pre clinical  clinical and epidemiological studies of  osteoarthritis  and  rheumatoid arthritis .” Related  Malic Acid Benefits Energy Levels  Skin Health   More Types of Apples Apple trees have been improved through selection over thousands of years  and today there are hundreds of varieties in existence. It’s estimated that there are about       known varieties  cultivars  that are grown in the United States and more than       varieties grown in the world  Apple skins range in color from bright red to yellow  green  pink  or bi  or tri colored patterns. They also come in a range of different tastes and levels of sweetness. According to researchers  the phytochemical composition of apple nutrition varies greatly between different varieties. Plus  there are also small changes in phytochemicals during the maturation and ripening periods. Some of the most common types of apples include  Red delicious Honeycrisp Fuji Gala Granny smith McIntosh Cortland Golden delicious Empire Braeburn Envy Jazz Cameo Jonagold Rome Macoun Zestar Mutsu Ambrosia Apples were originally brought to North America by European colonists during the   th century and have been a staple of the American diet ever since  think  apple pie  . Throughout history  they have had special religious and mythological significance in many cultures. For example  they are mentioned in the Bible in the story of Genesis about Adam and Eve. They have also had symbolic meaning in ancient Greek  European and various Christian traditions. About    million tons of apples are grown worldwide every year  China produces almost half of this total each year on average  followed by the United States  the second leading producer Turkey  Italy  India and Poland. Related  Fisetin  A Senolytic Antioxidant for Healthy Aging   More Recipes When it comes to picking apples at the grocery store or farmers market  definitely try to buy organic types. Unfortunately  the Environmental Working Group lists apples on the “Dirty Dozen” list of most chemically sprayed fruits and veggies on a nearly yearly basis. Research shows that apples are among the fruits/veggies with the highest number of pesticides among dozens of different kinds that are tested each year. Shop for organic apples  and then store them in the refrigerator to keep them fresh for longer. They have a pretty long shelf life and last for several weeks on average. Many of the antioxidants found in apples are considered delicate. They are preserved best when eaten raw or lightly cooked. High temperatures can negatively impact their nutrients. Apples are typically available all year. They are in peak season during fall but can be found pretty much anytime. You can use them in lots of different ways  such as in apple desserts  baked goods  on salads or in sauces. Make low sugar apple sauce  juices or smoothies  or simmer or bake them with some cinnamon and butter. They also make a great  portable post  or pre workout snack thanks to their quick releasing natural sugars than can raise your energy. Remember that while it’s always preferable to eat the whole apple  homemade apple juice is definitely a cut above the store bought kinds.

Top   Benefits How to Eat It Risks and Side Effects Apples are one of the fruits that have a higher potential to cause allergic reactions  along with peaches and kiwis. Fruit allergies are frequently observed as reactions in the mouth  lungs  face  nose and stomach. These can occur only minutes after consuming the trigger food and show up in itching and swelling of the mouth  lips and throat. If you or your children experience these reactions after eating apples or other food allergy symptoms  considering having an allergy test done before consuming them again. Apples might also cause digestive problems for some people. That’s because they contain FODMAP carbohydrates that some people have difficulty breaking down. Apples  along with pears and some other types of fruits and veggies  can potentially ferment in the gut and cause IBS  bloating and digestive discomfort. If you have these issues and can’t seem to figure out why  you might want to experiment with following a low FODMAP diet for a period of time. Conclusion Are apples high in nutrients? Yes  apple nutrition is a good source of pectin fiber  antioxidants  especially the skin  and vitamin C — plus they provide some potassium and vitamin K. Is it OK to eat an apple every day? As long as you don’t experience digestive issues  then yes. Health benefits associated with apples include protecting against types   diabetes  heart issues  some types of cancer  such as prostate and breast cancer  and assisting in weight management.Health Benefits of Your Favorite Fruits Moorings Park Communities November          bigstock Fresh Fruits assorted Fruits C           Large Eating plenty of fruit is a delicious and healthy way to add vitamins  minerals  and other nutrients to our diets every day.

The fruit is also high in phytochemicals  including quercetin  catechin  chlorogenic acid  and epicatechin  all of which have strong antioxidant properties.  Since apples contain carbohydrates  people with diabetes should try to stick with one small apple— equal to around    carbohydrates—per meal or snack.   Risks of Eating Apples Apples are unlikely to cause any serious side effects when consumed in moderation. However  some people experience bloating  gas  and digestive issues after eating apples. This is because apples are high in fiber and contain the FODMAPs fructose and sorbitol  which are sugars that some people can t tolerate.     People with an apple allergy should avoid apples and foods containing apples that could trigger symptoms. Studies show that     of people with birch pollen allergy develop pollen related food allergies  especially to apples. This is due to the similarity between apple proteins and birch pollen.   Lastly  while a few apple seeds are unlikely to cause harm  consuming too many can be dangerous. This is because chewed or crushed apple seeds release a highly toxic compound called cyanide.

They’re commonly used in recipes like pies  cookies  muffins  jam  salads  oatmeal  or smoothies. They also make a great snack or wedged and smeared with nut butter. In addition to their culinary versatility and numerous colors and flavors  apples are an exceptionally healthy fruit with many research backed benefits. Here are eight impressive health benefits of apples.  . Nutritious Apples are considered nutrient dense fruits  meaning they provide a lot of nutrients per serving. The current Dietary Guidelines for AmericansTrusted Source recommend   cups of fruit daily for a       calorie diet  emphasizing whole fruits like apples. One medium   ounce  oz  or     grams  g  apple offers the following nutrients  Calories      Carbs     g Fiber    g Vitamin C      of the Daily Value  DV  Copper     of the DV Potassium     of the DV Vitamin K     of the DV The same serving also provides  –  Trusted Source of the DV for vitamins E  B   and B . Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols  an important group of antioxidants. While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds  they’re likely responsibleTrusted Source for many of apples’ health benefits. To get the most out of apples  leave the skin on  as it contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols. Summary Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C. They also contain antioxidants  like vitamin E  and polyphenols  contributing to the fruit’s numerous health benefits.  . May support weight loss Apples are high in fiber and water  which makes them filling. In one studyTrusted Source  eating whole apples increased fullness more than consuming equal amounts of apple juice. This may happen because whole apples reduce gastric emptying — the rate at which your stomach empties. ResearchTrusted Source also suggests apple intake may significantly reduce Body Mass Index  BMI a weight related risk factor for heart disease. Interestingly  apple polyphenols may also haveTrusted Source anti obesity effects. Summary Apples are particularly filling due to their high fiber and water content. Their polyphenols may also have anti obesity effects.  . Could be good for your heart Apples have been linked to a lower chance of heart disease. Research has found that eating         g/d of whole apples is associated with a lower chanceTrusted Source of heart disease and risk factors such as high blood pressure. One reason may be that they contain soluble fiber. This fiber is also associatedTrusted Source with a lower chance of heart disease. Another reason may be that they offer polyphenols. Some of these may help lowerTrusted Source blood pressure. StudiesTrusted Source have also linked high intakes of flavonoids with a lower chance of stroke. Another study has also linked eating apples to a reduced chanceTrusted Source of stroke. Summary Apples promote heart health in several ways. They’re high in soluble fiber  which helps lower cholesterol. They also have polyphenols linked to lower blood pressure and chance of stroke.  . Linked to a lower chance of diabetes Eating apples may also reduce your chance of type   diabetes. A compilation of studies found that eating apples and pears was associated with an    Trusted Source reduction in type   diabetes risk. Just one serving per week may reduce the risk by   . The high amount of the polyphenol quercetin in apples could explainTrusted Source this beneficial effect. Summary Eating apples is linked to a lower risk of type   diabetes  potentially due to their polyphenol content.  . May promote gut health Apples contain pectin  a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic in your gut microbiome  and a healthy gut is often keyTrusted Source to better health. Since dietary fiber cannot be digested  pectin reaches your colon intact  promoting the growth of good bacteria.

New research suggests that  by beneficially altering your gut microbiota  apples may help protectTrusted Source against chronic diseases like obesity  type   diabetes  heart disease  and cancer. Summary The type of fiber found in apples improves your gut friendly bacteria  which may be why the fruit is thought to help protect against chronic diseases.  . May help prevent cancer Antioxidants in apples may offerTrusted Source beneficial effects against certain types of cancers  including lung  breast  and digestive tract cancers. ResearchTrusted Source suggests these effects may be attributed to apple polyphenols keeping cancerous cells from multiplying. Moreover  one studyTrusted Source in women reported that higher apple intakes were linked to a lower chance of cancer death. However  further human research is needed to better understand the possible link between apples and cancer prevention — for example  to identify adequate amounts and eating timing. Summary Apple’s fiber and antioxidant content has been linked to a reduced chance of getting certain types of cancer. However  more research on humans is needed.  . Could help fight asthma Antioxidant rich apples may helpTrusted Source reduce airway inflammation related to allergic asthma. Apple skin is rich in the antioxidant quercetin  which can help regulateTrusted Source your immune system and reduce inflammation. Theoretically  this could make apples effective against late phases of bronchial asthma responses.

Still  more human research is needed on the topic. Summary Apples contain antioxidant and anti inflammatory compounds that may help regulate immune responses and protect against asthma. However  more research  especially in humans  is needed.  . May help protect your brain Quercetin in apples may protectTrusted Source your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress. A meta analysis of    animal studiesTrusted Source suggests quercetin may have some preventive properties against Alzheimer’s disease  AD . Still  the researchers questioned some of the study methodologies and believed more research is needed to conclude. Remember that most research focuses on a specific compound instead of whole apples. Therefore  further research is still needed  specifically on the effects of apples  before any conclusions can be drawn. Summary Quercetin in apples may protect your brain against oxidative stress. However  further research is needed to validate the effect of eating the whole fruit.  . May improve mental health Eating more vegetables and fruit like apples may help your mental health  according to one      systematic reviewTrusted Source.

That said  more research is needed to investigate this. They’re rich in fiber and antioxidants. Eating them is linked to a lower chance of getting many chronic conditions  including diabetes  heart disease  and cancer. Apples may also promote weight loss and improve gut and brain health. Even though more research is needed to better understand how apples affect human health  you can’t go wrong with this tasty  versatile  and easily accessible fruit.Growing apples in the home garden Quick facts Apple trees need at least   hours of sun per day during the growing season. Two varieties are required for successful pollination  one can be a crabapple. Dwarf apple trees will start bearing fruit   to   years after planting. Standard size trees can take up to   years to bear fruit. Some varieties are more susceptible to insect and disease damage than others. Prune annually to keep apple trees healthy and productive. Two trees can provide plenty of apples Apples are pollinated by insects  with bees and flies transferring pollen from flowers of one apple tree to those of another. But you don t need to plant a whole orchard to enjoy apples right off the tree. Two trees will reward any family with enough fruit to enjoy and share with friends. Apples require pollen from a different apple variety to grow fruit. If you only have room in your yard for one tree  there may be crab apples in your neighborhood to provide the pollen your tree needs.  Most apple trees are grafted onto dwarfing rootstocks and only grow to be about      feet tall. So even if you re short on space  you probably have space for two trees. Care through the seasons March—For existing trees  prune before growth begins  after coldest weather has passed April  May—Plant bare root trees as soon as the soil can be worked April  May—If last year s growth was less than    inches  apply compost around the base of tree May  June—Plant potted trees after threat of frost has passed May  June—As flower buds begin to turn pink  start watching for insect and disease symptoms May through October—Water trees as you would any other tree in your yard June  July—Thin fruit remove smallest apples to encourage larger fruit August through October—Harvest taste fruit when it appears to be fully colored if it s too starchy  wait a few days October  November—Rake up fallen leaves and fruit  compost or discard November—Apply tree wrap to prevent winter injury November through March—Look for deer and vole damage  put fencing around tree if needed Selecting plants Before choosing an apple tree to plant  take a look around your neighborhood. A pollen source should be within     feet of the apple tree you plant to ensure the pollen gets to your tree. If you don t see any crabapples or other apple trees that close  your best bet is to plant two trees of different varieties. When purchasing an apple tree  you are actually selecting a plant made up of two genetically different individuals grafted together  the scion and the rootstock. The scion is the aboveground part of the tree that produces the type of fruit desired  ex. Honeycrisp or Haralson . The rootstock plays a major role in determining the tree s ultimate size and how long it will take to bear fruit. Variety tables provide hardiness  size and compatibility information for apple varieties that have proven to do well in northern climates.     Learn how to choose a location  prepare for planting and space trees.     From watering to weeding to thinning fruit  caring for your apple trees throughout the year will help your plants produce plenty of apples to harvest.     Prune a tree to have well spaced branches and a balanced appearance  while eliminating broken  diseased or dead branches.     Managing pests and diseases Many things can affect apple trees  leaves  flowers and fruits. Changes in physical appearance and plant health can be caused by the environment  plant diseases  insects and wildlife. In order to address what you’re seeing  it is important to make a correct diagnosis.  You can find additional help identifying common pest problems by using the online diagnostic tools What insect is this? and What s wrong with my plant? or by sending a sample to the UMN Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic. You can use Ask a Master Gardener to share pictures and get advice. Note that just because you are seeing some damage doesn’t mean all hope is lost. One apple tree will produce a lot of apples  so losing a small number to birds and bugs isn t a reason to stress.     Authors  Emily E. Hoover  Extension horticulturalist  Emily S.

Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit  though apples are also used commercially for vinegar  juice  jelly  applesauce  and apple butter and are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of the global crop also is used for cider  wine  and brandy. Fresh apples are eaten raw or cooked. There are a variety of ways in which cooked apples are used  frequently  they are used as a pastry filling  apple pie being perhaps the archetypal American dessert. Especially in Europe  fried apples characteristically accompany certain dishes of sausage or pork. Apples provide vitamins A and C  are high in carbohydrates  and are an excellent source of dietary fibre. History and domestication Malus species are native to the temperate zones of both hemispheres. The cultivated apple is thought to have been domesticated from a wild apple  M. sieversii  in the Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia some      –       years ago. From there it spread to western Europe along the Silk Road and hybridized with a number of wild crabapples  including M. baccata from Siberia  M. orientalis from the Caucasus  and M. sylvestris  the major secondary genetic contributor  from other parts of Europe.

A Quiz Over the centuries  improved selections have been made  and distinct varieties were recognized more than       years ago. Hundreds of varieties were recognized in Europe before the settlement of the Americas. As the wave of colonial settlement moved across North America  it was accompanied by the distribution of seedling apple varieties  first by Native Americans and trappers and later by settlers and itinerants who became local legendary figures  the most prominent being Johnny Appleseed  John Chapman a professional nurseryman who planted apple trees extensively in Ohio and Indiana. In the first quarter of the   st century  the largest producers of apples were China  the United States  and Turkey. Physical description Apple trees are generally small trees  and a given variety can be grafted onto dwarfing or semi dwarfing rootstocks for smaller and less vigorous plants. If left untrimmed  a tree grown with standard  seedling  rootstock will often reach a height of   metres     feet  with an equally large crown diametre. The bark is usually brown and scaly. The simple leaves are roughly oval in shape and usually have fine teeth along the margins. Apple flowers are showy with five white petals  often tinged with pink  and numerous stamens. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects  and most varieties require cross pollination for fertilization. The apple itself is a pome  fleshy  fruit  in which the ripened ovary and surrounding tissue both become fleshy and edible. When harvested  apples are usually roundish   –   cm   –  inches  in diameter  and some shade of red  green  or yellow in colour  they vary in size  shape  and acidity depending on the variety  of which there are thousands. Apple varieties fall into three broad classes      cider varieties    cooking varieties  and     dessert varieties  which differ widely but tend to emphasize colour  size  aroma  smoothness  and perhaps crispness and tang. Many varieties are relatively high in sugar  only mildly acidic  and very low in tannin. In the United States  popular dessert varieties include the Honeycrisp  Red Delicious  Gala  Granny Smith  and Golden Delicious. Apple varieties that ripen during late summer are generally of poor quality for storage  while those that ripen in late autumn may be stored for as long as one year. For long holding  temperatures only slightly above the freezing point of the fruit are generally desirable. Apples may also be stored in inert gases or in controlled atmospheres.  Are you a student?

Learn More Cultivation Since the apple requires a considerable period of dormancy  it thrives in areas having a distinct winter period  generally from latitude   ° to   °  both north and south. Northward  apple growing is limited by low winter temperatures and a short growing season. The soils in which apple trees grow must be well drained  fertilizers can be used if the yield is not high enough. Rolling hilltops or the sloping sides of hills are preferred because they provide “air drainage ” allowing the colder  heavier air to drain away to the valley below during frosty spring nights  when blossoms or young fruit would be destroyed by exposure to cold. Scions of desired varieties are commonly grafted onto hardy nursery seedlings of about    months of age  orchard planting follows one or two years later. Management during the six to eight years before appreciable apple production is reached may consist of little more than protection from competing vegetation and pests. Careful attention to pruning is required  however  especially during the first five years  so that the main scaffold branches will be well distributed along the trunk and to prevent development of weak crotches  which can break under heavy fruit loads. With mature trees  a rigorous spraying regime must be followed to protect against insect pests and diseases and possibly to delay spring development  to thin young fruit  and to hold the autumn drop of ripening fruit to a minimum.

They re the unofficial mascot of lunchbox side dishes and they make a delicious afternoon snack when dipped in peanut butter. They re even available at McDonald’s as a healthy Happy Meal side. It’s no surprise then that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest apple producers  second only to China. We produce an average of     million bushels of apples every year  according to the U.S. Apple Association. But with so many varieties to choose from  is there one that reigns supreme? Here’s what we found out about the nutritional profiles of the different kinds of apples. What is the healthiest apple? Whether it’s Granny Smith  Golden Delicious  Honeycrisp or Gala  any type of apple is going to benefit your health. Only   .   of American adults meet their fruit intake recommendations  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. The more apples in your diet  the better  says registered dietitian Danielle Crumble Smith  regardless of the type. Some  however  have unique health benefits. Red Delicious apples are the healthiest from an antioxidant standpoint  Crumble Smith says. The darker the color of the apple  the richer it’ll be in antioxidants. Antioxidants help neutralize the free radicals in our bodies which  when imbalanced  can cause cell damage and lead to disease. “Aiming for different types of deep colors can help ensure that you’re getting a variety of different types of antioxidants ” she says. If you’re looking to increase your vitamin C intake  try a Pink Lady or McIntosh apple  Crumble Smith says. If fiber is what you seek  go for a Honeycrisp or Granny Smith.  Across the board with apples one thing s for sure  Crumble Smith says  eat them raw and unpeeled. “Eating the skin ensures that you’re really going to get all of that fiber  get all of those antioxidants because the skin is where a lot of it is ” Crumble Smith says. The vitamin C content can also decrease during the cooking process because vitamin C is soluble in water and sensitive to temperature. Healthiest fruits These   have the most health benefits Are apples healthy? Yes – apples are packed with vitamins and minerals and are an important part of a healthy diet  just like other fruits. They’re a good source of fiber and contain pectin  a fiber that acts as a prebiotic to aid colon function and digestion.  Apples are high in vitamin C  which has antioxidant properties to help us absorb and store iron  maintain strong tissues  boost our immune system and produce more collagen for hair  skin and nail health.  Apples also contain quercetin  a flavonoid with antioxidant properties that studies show may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and protect against allergies because it acts as a natural antihistamine.

Add to smoothies  This is an easy way to get all the benefits of a raw apple  especially if you keep the fiber rich skins on. Add in yogurt  cinnamon and a banana to create an apple cinnamon smoothie. Add to salads  Thinly sliced apples add a distinct crunch and sweetness to an otherwise boring salad. Apples are listed on the “Dirty Dozen” list  or the Environmental Working Group’s analysis of the    vegetables with the highest traces of pesticides. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them  Crumble Smith says. Buying organic is one option if you re eating apples daily. Still  organic produce is not completely pesticide free because farmers often use naturally derived pesticides derived. Research published in the Journal of Toxicology found the pesticides in the produce on the  Dirty Dozen  list are  at negligible levels  and substituting organic didn t result in significant risk reduction. Which apple has the least sugar? Green apples  like Granny Smiths  are more tart and generally have less sugar than other kinds of apples. The amount is not significant enough to make a difference other than in taste  says Crumble Smith. Granny Smith apples have about  .  grams of sugar per     grams  Fuji apples have a little less than    grams.  The sugar in apples is not bad for you  it can even help you combat the afternoon slump.

Apples are certainly popular—ranking among the top three fruits produced around the world. They are easy to store and transport  and as a result  are typically available year round in the U.S. In this piece we’ll explore how apples may benefit health and the best types for baking versus munching straight off the core. Source Of Fiber  insoluble and soluble Phytochemicals  quercetin  catechin  chlorogenic acid  anthocyanin  Vitamin C One serving  or one medium apple  provides about    calories    gram fat    gram protein     grams carbohydrate     grams sugar  naturally occurring and   grams fiber.  Apples and Health Apples are rich in quercetin and pectin  both of which are credited for supplying apples with their health benefits. Quercetin is a flavonoid  a type of naturally occurring plant chemical that has antioxidant and anti inflammatory effects. Pectin is a type of soluble fiber that may help prevent constipation and have a modest effect on lowering LDL  the “bad” cholesterol. Pectin is also fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon  which produces short chain fatty acids that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases  including certain cancers and bowel disorders.       Fresh  whole apples offer the most nutrients. Discarding the skin removes much of the fiber and the majority of flavonoids. Dehydrating or drying the apples removes vitamin C  which is predominantly in the flesh. In addition  sugar  along with extra calories  is often added to dried apples. Clear apple juice undergoes filtering and pasteurization  which removes most of the flavonoids and fibers.  Overall research shows a benefit when adding apples to the diet. The studies below looked at the health effects of apples in the diet over time  or examined the effects of specific phytochemicals in apples. Cardiovascular disease Type   diabetes Weight management Should I be concerned about pesticides? Apples continuously top the list of fruits highest in pesticide residues. They often require more pesticides as they are particularly susceptible to bugs and disease. Although apples are generally washed before being sold  the amount of remaining residue is unknown and may vary widely  partly depending on the type and amount of pesticide applied . However  the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  have developed a national pesticide residue database called the Pesticide Data Program  PDP  to collect data each year on pesticide residues in food. One of the most common pesticides used on apples after harvest is diphenylamine  used to prevent apple scald or browning of the skin that can occur during storage. A      analysis from the PDP found that     of     apple samples contained residues of this chemical at  .     .  ppm  which is below the EPA’s tolerance level of    ppm. A tolerance level is the maximum amount of residue allowed on a raw food. This amount is based on a review of numerous scientific studies to determine possible harmful effects the chemical could have on humans  the amount of residue likely to remain in or on the food  and the amount of the food that people typically eat. Although some pesticide residue can permeate into the flesh  washing and peeling the apple skin removes much of the pesticide. Apple skin supplies the majority of healthy phytochemicals and fiber  so it is not best to remove it. If one eats several apples a week and is unsure of the amount of pesticides used  purchasing organically grown apples may be an option  although direct evidence is not available that there is an important difference in health effects. Some general tips for cleaning apples  The Food and Drug Administration recommends washing all produce thoroughly  including organic  under running water before preparing or eating. Firm produce like apples may be scrubbed with a clean produce brush. They do not recommend washing produce with soap  detergent  or even commercial produce washes. The washes are intended for killing bacteria rather than removing pesticides  and studies have shown that water is just as  if not more  effective than produce washes for removing bacteria. Baking soda is effective at removing bacteria and breaking down pesticide residues so they are more easily rinsed off  but this method requires a few extra steps. Soak the apple in a baking soda solution of   teaspoon of baking soda and   cups water for       minutes  then rinse well. To save time  soak a large batch of apples  rinse well  and then dry each thoroughly with a towel before storing in the refrigerator  as any remaining excess moisture can promote mold or spoilage . Keep in mind that the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables outweigh potential pesticide risks  and should not deter one from including apples as part of a healthful diet. Storage To prolong freshness  store in the refrigerator in the crisper drawer. They will usually remain fresh for at least     months  if not longer. Apples are a climacteric fruit  meaning that they continue to ripen after harvesting due to emitting a gas called ethylene. Cold temperatures slow down the production of ethylene. Even so  apples will still emit some ethylene when refrigerated and can speed the ripening of other produce stored nearby. Store apples in their own drawer apart from other produce to prevent this from happening. If stored at room temperature  the enzymes and ethylene gas in apples quicken ripening. They will last on your counter for about     weeks but the texture can change during this time. Serve There are at least a dozen types of apples found in U.S. supermarkets  but up to     varieties are available. Check out local farms and farmers markets for more unusual heirloom varieties. Some are best for cooking and baking  and others are enjoyed raw for snacking. They range from sweet to tart  and may produce a hearty crunch or a light crispy bite. Tart  mildly sweet apples with firm crisp flesh that don’t become mushy at high temperatures are best for baking  Jonagolds  Granny Smith  Honeycrisp  Melrose  Cortland  Braeburn. Juicy and sweet flavors are often chosen for eating  Gala  Red and Golden Delicious  Fuji  McIntosh. If you prefer tart over sweet  baking apples can certainly be eaten as well  Some fun ways to enjoy apples  Cut one apple into thin slices and spread with nut or seed butter. Enjoy a sweet/salty  crunchy/creamy combo by pairing apple slices with thin slices of cheddar cheese. Apple sandwich  Remove the center and seeds of an apple with a corer and slice the apple into rounds about a ½ inch thick. Spread one apple slice with nut or seed butter and sprinkle with granola or trail mix. Then place another apple slice on top. Oven baked apple chips  Core apple and slice very thinly or with a mandoline. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet or parchment paper. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at     degrees F for one hour  higher temperatures can burn the apples . Flip apple slices and bake for up to   hour more or until apple chips feel dry. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely. Waldorf salad  Chop   large apples into small chunks and add to large bowl with ½ cup walnuts    sliced celery rib  and ¼ cup raisins. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Prepare the dressing by combining ½ cup nonfat plain yogurt      tablespoons mayonnaise  teaspoon of lemon zest  and pinch of pepper.

Apple juice and apple cider are different  Cider is produced when raw apples are mashed and pressed to extract the liquid. It is not filtered and sold either pasteurized or unpasteurized. This causes cider to appear cloudy  as it contains pulp and sediment. It is more acidic and contains more flavonoids than apple juice. Apple juice has been filtered to remove solids and pasteurized so that it remains fresher longer. Sugar is sometimes added. During filtration  the tart and bitter flavors from the natural apple flavonoids may be removed  so apple juice typically has a uniform sweet flavor. How do apples get their shape? Apples are among the oldest and most recognizable fruits in the world. But have you ever really considered an apple’s shape? Using theory and experiments  researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences show how apples get their distinct spherical shape  and the characteristic dimple at the top where the stem grows.

Here are ten impressive health benefits of apples.   . Apples are nutritious  Apples are considered nutrient dense fruits  meaning they provide a lot of nutrients per serving.  The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends   cups of fruit daily for a       calorie diet  emphasizing whole fruits like apples.  One medium   ounce  oz  or     grams  g  apple offers the following nutrients   Calories       Carbs     g  Fiber    g  Vitamin C      of the Daily Value  DV Copper     of the DV  Potassium     of the DV  Vitamin K     of the DV  The same serving also provides  –   of the DV for vitamins E  B   and B .  Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols  an important group of antioxidants. While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds  they’re likely responsible for many of apples’ health benefits.  To get the most out of apples  leave the skin on  as it contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols.   . Apples may support weight loss  Apples are high in fiber and water  which makes them filling.  In one study eating whole apples increased fullness more than consuming equal amounts of apple juice. This may happen because whole apples reduce gastric emptying — the rate at which your stomach empties.  Research also suggests apple intake may significantly reduce Body Mass Index  BMI a weight related risk factor for heart disease.  Interestingly  apple polyphenols may also have anti obesity effects.   . Apples could be good for your heart  Apples have been linked to a lower chance of heart disease. Research has found that eating         g/d of whole apples is associated with a lower chance of heart disease and risk factors such as high blood pressure.  One reason may be that they contain soluble fiber. This fiber is also associated with a lower chance of heart disease.  Another reason may be that they offer polyphenols. Some of these may help lower blood pressure. Studies have also linked high intakes of flavonoids with a lower chance of stroke.  Another study has also linked eating apples to a reduced chanceof stroke.   . Apples are linked to a lower chance of diabetes  Eating apples may also reduce your chance of type   diabetes.

The high amount of the polyphenol quercetin in apples could explain this beneficial effect.   . Apples may promote gut health  Apples contain pectin  a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic in your gut microbiome  and a healthy gut is often key to better health.  Since dietary fiber cannot be digested  pectin reaches your colon intact  promoting the growth of good bacteria. It especially improves the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes  the two main types of bacteria in your gut.  New research suggests that  by beneficially altering your gut microbiota  apples may help protect against chronic diseases like obesity  type   diabetes  heart disease  and cancer.   . Apples may help prevent cancer  Antioxidants in apples may offer beneficial effects against certain types of cancers  including lung  breast  and digestive tract cancers.  Research suggests these effects may be attributed to apple polyphenols keeping cancerous cells from multiplying.  Moreover  one study in women reported that higher apple intakes were linked to a lower chance of cancer death.  However  further human research is needed to better understand the possible link between apples and cancer prevention — for example  to identify adequate amounts and eating timing.   . Apples could help fight asthma  Antioxidant rich apples may help reduce airway inflammation related to allergic asthma.  Apple skin is rich in the antioxidant quercetin  which can help regulate your immune system and reduce inflammation. Theoretically  this could make apples effective against late phases of bronchial asthma responses.  Supporting this  test tube and animal studies suggest quercetin may be suitable for allergic inflammatory diseases like asthma and sinusitis.  Still  more human research is needed on the topic.   . Apples may help protect your brain  Quercetin in apples may protect your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress.  A meta analysis of    animal studies suggests quercetin may have some preventive properties against Alzheimer’s disease  AD . Still  the researchers questioned some of the study methodologies and believed more research is needed to conclude.  Remember that most research focuses on a specific compound instead of whole apples. Therefore  further research is still needed  specifically on the effects of apples  before any conclusions can be drawn.   . Apples may improve mental health  Eating more vegetables and fruit like apples may help your mental health  according to one      systematic review .  That said  the study found this benefit kicks in if you eat at least   servings of fruit and vegetables daily  consistent with the recommendations of the American Dietary Guidelines for daily fruit and vegetable intake.  In addition  a      British study found that adolescents who consume fewer vegetables and fruit in their diet tend to have poorer mental health.    . May help with digestive diseases  Research suggests that eating fruit like apples may help reduce the chance of getting gastroesophageal reflux disease  GERD .  Multiple studies have also suggested that eating apples can help your food digest better  which may be helpful with constipation. But the extent of the effect may depend on the type of apple you’re eating.  An apple a day might not quite keep the doctor away  but it can certainly help with preventive health measures.

This review provides an up‐to‐date overview of the significant bioactive compounds in apples together with their reported pharmacological actions against chronic diseases such as diabetes  cancer  and cardiovascular diseases. For consumers to fully gain these health benefits  it is important to ensure an all‐year‐round supply of highly nutritious and good‐quality apples. Therefore  after harvest  the physicochemical and nutritional quality attributes of apples are maintained by applying various postharvest treatments and hurdle techniques. The impact of these postharvest practices on the safety of apples during storage is also highlighted. This review emphasizes that advancements in postharvest management strategies that extend the storage life of apples should be optimized to better preserve the bioactive components crucial to daily dietary needs and this can help improve the overall health of consumers. Keywords  health  hidden hunger  microbial safety  micronutrient deficiencies  polyphenol  . INTRODUCTION The consumption of apple  Malus domestica Borkh. Family  Rosaceae which is one of the most grown fruits globally  has been encouraged since time immemorial due to the sheer abundance of nutrients and bioactive compounds present therein. The beneficial components in apples vary in the type and amount that can be found within the cultivars or varieties from different countries  regions  or continents  and differ in the composition in parts  fruit  flesh  peel  leaf  seed  or root Kalinowska et al.       . The availability of these nutrients and bioactives in apple makes it one of the most sought‐after fruits globally  with useful applications in the production of juices  beverages  wines  ciders  vinegar  and other food products of immense commercial value. The apple industry is estimated at be worth     billion globally  Candrawinata et al.       . This huge global demand for the apple fruit has sparked interest in discovering newer ways of establishing constant supply with most of the research focus placed on extending shelf‐life  possibly  at the expense of its nutritive values. For example  over        articles on apples have been published in the past    years and indexed on the largest‐known  peer‐reviewed scientific database—Scopus®. Using the keywords  “postharvest” AND “treatment” AND “storage” AND “apples” during the literature search  the number of research outputs retrieved was      Figure    viewed    May      . These articles explored and developed postharvest strategies for the storage of apples. Most of these articles    .  were published in the last two decades  and out of the total  only  .   .  and  .   within this subject area accounted for apple studies linked to medicine  veterinary  and nursing  respectively. Exceptional progress has been made in the development of postharvest tools at a commercial scale to maintain the freshness and safety of apples and other fresh produce  Mahajan et al.       . While the advances in this area of apple research are commendable and must be sustained  these are often applied in combination with appropriate storage management strategies to extend storage or shelf‐life with often a limited focus on bioactive components of apples.

Source  Scopus       Micronutrient deficiencies  MNDs  “hidden hunger” is a major global challenge with an enormous impact on the health of the most vulnerable within the population. There is a heightened global consumer consciousness of the full benefits of dietary interventions of fruit and vegetables on human health and the impact of hidden hunger. Therefore  this article presents an overview of the bioactive compounds of apples and their pharmacological effects on chronic diseases. In addition  the article assessed the recent postharvest technological advances in the preservation of apples that are crucial in maintaining fruit quality during long‐term storage. Furthermore  this review presents future direction in apple research to ensure that the medicinal values can be fully harnessed and “an apple a day can truly keep the doctor away.”  . BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN APPLES Essential or bioactive compounds in apples include macronutrients  vitamins  minerals  elements  flavanols  hydroxycinnamic acids  flavonols  dihydrochalcones  anthocyanins  and others. Numerous studies over the last three decades have shown that these compounds in apples exhibit significant biological effects on improving human health. Thus  the subsequent subsections discuss the role played by each of these compounds on consumer health.  . . Nutrients The nutrients in apples include macronutrients  e.g.  sugars  fibers  pectin  fat  protein organic acids  e.g.  malic acid vitamins  e.g.  C  E  B  minerals  e.g.  potassium  calcium  nitrogen  magnesium and trace elements  e.g.  zinc  iron  copper  manganese Skinner et al.       . These not only supply energy but also participate in many important processes in the body such as growth  bone health  immune functions  and so on. For example  malic  citric  and tartaric acids help the liver in the digestion processes in the body  Pal et al.       . The content and distribution of the sugars  mainly fructose and sucrose together with the organic acids  are primarily responsible for the fruit s taste and appeal to consumers and possibly account for the major cultivar to cultivar or variety to variety differences  Ma et al.       . In terms of the dietary fiber content in apples  the fresh whole fruit was found to be composed of approximately between    and    total fiber. The insoluble fiber represents about     while the remainder is soluble  largely pectin  Li et al.        Skinner et al.       . Diets rich in high fiber have been shown to confer immense health benefits such as gastrointestinal tract wellbeing and reduced mortality from cancers and cardiovascular diseases  Kim   Je        Myhrstad et al.       . The vitamins and minerals in apples also provide essential micronutrients that aid the normal functions of biological and biochemical reactions in the body. For example  vitamins C and E in apples contribute to the total antioxidant potential widely attributed to the fruit by donating single hydrogen equivalents to free radicals rendering them stable and leading to their eventual detoxification. The vitamins also participate in the conversion of the oxidized forms of other antioxidants back to their active reduced states  Garcia‐Closas et al.        Njus et al.       . Potassium and calcium minerals usually present in quantities of about  .  – .   and  .  – .   mg/g  respectively  in fresh apples are essential in promoting bone health and can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis  Skinner et al.        Yaegashi et al.       . Besides  the accumulation of calcium in apples also helps in the firming of the fruit and protection of its cell wall from fungal infections  Aghdam et al.       . The importance of the trace mineral  zinc  in normal body growth  development  immune system  and as a cofactor for many enzyme‐catalyzed metabolic reactions has been well reviewed in the literature  Roohani et al.       . With zinc deficiency still prevalent in children in low‐middle‐income countries  Gupta et al.       the daily consumption of apples that contain about  . – .  µg zinc per     g fresh whole apple or      µg zinc per     g apple pomace  Skinner et al.        can go a long way in mitigating the deficiency. It was recently reported that the concentration of zinc in wild apples may be more than twice that obtained in cultivated apples indicating the impact of selection on zinc accumulation in the domestication process  Liao et al.       .  . . Polyphenols Apples contain a variety of compounds with health‐promoting attributes but those belonging to the polyphenol class of phytochemicals are predominant and are particularly known for conferring antioxidant quality to the fruit. The polyphenol composition in the different parts of some common apple cultivars and antioxidant values are summarized in Table  . Polyphenols  with thousands of member compounds  represent one of the most diverse groups of compounds. The basic polyphenols are structurally composed of phenols that are attached to carbon backbones  C ‐C  to C –C  and C ‐C –C   or nitrogen. Some other polyphenol chemical structures are referred to as atypical since they exhibit complexity in their structures and thus are intricate to be assigned to a single class  Tsao       .

Total polyphenol concentration was carried out on apple samples using the Folin–Ciocalteu method but different extraction protocols may have been employed.  Antioxidant activity was conducted using the whole apple fruit extracts except when stated otherwise. †  flesh peel . Symbols a and b refer to when pomace and seed apple samples  respectively  were used for the analysis. In apples  polyphenol subclasses—flavanols  hydroxycinnamic acids  flavonols  dihydrochalcones  and anthocyanins are notable  Kschonsek et al.        Rana   Bhushan        Wojdylo et al.       . These chemical structures  Figure    have been related to the multifaceted bioactivities of apples in many studies. Flavanol monomers  e.g.  catechin and epicatechin  and oligomers—proanthocyanidins  e.g.  procyanidins A and B —are flavonoid polyphenols with the C –C –C  structural motif and have their C  heterocyclic  O‐containing  ring hydroxylated  Strat et al.       . In whole apples  the total flavanol concentration ranged from    to     mg/    g  consisting majorly of about ≈ .  mg/    g catechin   . – .  mg/    g epicatechin    –  .  mg/    g procyanidin dimer  and   .  mg/    g proanthocyanidin polymers  Bondonno et al.       .

Sources  Wojdylo et al.       Rana and Bhushan       and Kschonsek et al.        Furthermore  phenolic acids in apples are mainly represented in the form of hydroxycinnamic acids and the low‐occurring hydroxylbenzoic acids such as gentisic and syringic acid. Hydroxycinnamic acids are so‐named due to their derivation from cinnamic acid and are often esterified to quinic acids or glucose in foods  Kumar   Goel       . Notable examples include  ‐caffeoylquinic acid   ‐p‐coumaroylquinic acid  and  ‐p‐coumaroylquinic acid which are present in approximately   .    .   and  .  mg/    g ratio  respectively  in whole apples  Bondonno et al.       . Quercetin and its glycosides are the primary flavonols found in apples occurring in about  . – .  mg/    g edible portion amounts and are typical of the  ‐hydroxyflavone structural backbone  D Andrea       . Quercetin glycoside  rutin  containing the disaccharide rutinose  is one of the most studied and pharmacologically active in apples  Latos‐Brozio   Masek       . Dihydrochalcones  notably  phloretin and phloridzin  structurally comprise the C –C –C  backbone bicyclic flavonoids but without the heterocyclic C ring and the α–β double bond  Calliste et al.       . Phloretin and phloridzin are present in whole apple fruit at a concentration of  .  and  .  mg/    g  respectively  with the latter often used as a marker to distinguish apples from other adulterants since it is mostly unique to the Rosaceae family  Bondonno et al.       . The presence of the dihydroxyacetophenone pharmacophore in phloretin also confers potent antioxidant qualities  Rana   Bhushan       . Anthocyanins structures contain the anthocyanidin core bound to several glycosidic moieties at the C   C   or C  positions. They are derivatives of  ‐phenylbenzopyrylium salts but with many attached hydroxyl and methoxy groups  Smeriglio et al.        and may be responsible for the bright colors  red  purple  of apples. The peels of red‐fleshed apple varieties were reported to contain total anthocyanin content measured as cyanidin  ‐glucoside equivalents    . –   .  mg/    g fresh weight  that is more than the white‐fleshed varieties   . –   mg/    g fresh weight  and may also account for the higher antioxidant capacity values obtained in the study  Wang et al.       .  . PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF APPLE CONSTITUENTS AND POTENTIALS IN CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION It is often said “an apple a day  keeps the doctor away” due to the numerous health benefits popularly associated with the ingestion of the fruit. However  these benefits have mostly been proven in in vitro  in vivo experiments as well as a few clinical trials. Many observational studies have also revealed positive correlations between apple intake and lower risk of developing many chronic diseases or dying from them  Bondonno et al.       . Therefore  this section elucidates the major underlying biological effects that have been attributed to the compounds present in apples. The subsections primarily focus on the activities of these compounds in modulating oxidative stress  inflammation  and gastrointestinal tract  GIT  flora for health benefits. In addition  the subsection highlights the recent scientific evidence on the potential of apple supplementation against selected chronic diseases such as diabetes  obesity  cancer  and cardiovascular diseases.  . . Antioxidant properties of apples Oxidative stress is implicated mostly in the development of many chronic diseases including diabetes  obesity  cancer  hypertension  and cardiovascular diseases  Egea et al.       . The occurrence of oxidative stress is a consequence of the inability of cells to regulate the production and utilization of cellular reactive oxygen  or nitrogen  species  ROS . The process of ROS generation—either endogenously in normal metabolism and in mitochondria or exogenously from exposure to xenobiotics and the environment—is usually tightly controlled by inherent cellular antioxidants that act by different mechanisms and at various stages to maintain the cellular redox homeostasis  Figure   . This process involves enzymes  proteins  vitamins  carotenoids  polyphenols  and minerals as presented  Anwar et al.        Nimse   Pal       . Any compromise in the amount or actions of these antioxidants allows the uncontrolled overproduction of ROS  which leads to the onset or propagation of chronic diseases via many oxidative pathways. These activities have been reviewed comprehensively  Pisoschi et al.        Zuo et al.        and would not be the focus of this article. To summarize  three different steps of antioxidant actions in the regulation of ROS activities have been described in the literature. The first action involves preventing or suppressing the formation of excess ROS  for example  the superoxide dismutase  SOD  enzyme converts intracellular superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide  which is in turn converted to water by catalase  CAT  or glutathione peroxidase  GPx Nimse   Pal       . Second is the direct scavenging of excess ROS already produced thereby terminating oxidative chain propagations. Vitamins C and E and reduced glutathione are notable examples of antioxidants employing this mechanism  Oroian   Escriche       . The third level of action involves the repairing mechanisms that ensure the removal of ROS‐mediated damaged cellular macromolecules by de novo antioxidants such as proteolytic and DNA‐repair enzymes  Oyenihi et al.       . FIGURE   The annotation of sources  enzymes  and minerals  A and cellular processes for the generation of reactive oxygen species  ROS B  The supplementation with exogenous antioxidants in the attempt to complement the capacity of endogenous antioxidants and to compensate for any depletion in their amounts or functions is a widespread strategy to boost the overall cellular antioxidant defense system. Dietary intake through the consumption of fruits  vegetables  and herbs containing antioxidants  notably  polyphenols  carotenoids  and vitamins  remains invaluable sources for such exogenous supplementation. For example  the daily dietary intake of apples    ‘Fuji’ weighing ∼    g  for   days was shown to increase SOD and GPx enzymes in the blood of hemodialysis patients  Giaretta et al.       . Apples contain high amounts of polyphenols and have been singled out as the major contributor to their antioxidant qualities due to positive correlations obtained between polyphenol concentrations and antioxidant values  Zhao et al.       . Polyphenols consist of diverse groups of antioxidants  which operate at different levels of antioxidant actions that are linked to their chemical structures. They possess aromatic rings  a highly conjugated system  and many free hydroxyl groups  features that are integral for the donation of electrons or hydrogen atoms to neutralize ROS and to chelate oxidative metals via different postulated mechanisms  Olszowy        Zhang   Tsao       . Furthermore  polyphenol supplementation has been reported to also improve the activities of SOD  CAT  GPx enzymes through the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid‐related factor‐   Nrf   upon signaling by ROS  Zhang   Tsao       .  . . Modulation of the immune system/inflammation by apples Inflammation and oxidative stress are inseparable partners since they exert their cellular effects through interconnected molecular pathways designed to propagate mutual signal cascades. However  excess activation of the two phenomena in concert can accelerate the development or exacerbation of chronic diseases as has been demonstrated in accelerated aging  Petersen   Smith       arthritis  Marchev et al.       type   diabetes  obesity  Rains   Jain       cancer  Piotrowski et al.       and cardiovascular diseases  Wenzel et al.       . Inflammatory cells  when signaled  mostly carry out their cellular functions through ROS‐mediated pathways. For example  macrophages have been shown to defend the cell from invaders via the generation of ROS  Ahmed et al.       . Chronic inflammation characterized by excess pro‐inflammatory cytokines  chemokines  and prostaglandins is facilitated through the continuous overproduction of oxidative stress as well as the inhibition of antioxidant defense systems  and is hindered upon the activation of the antioxidant transcription factor—Nrf . In the same vein  oxidative stress increases inflammation by stimulating stress signals  notably extracellular signal‐regulated kinase  ERK c‐Jun NH ‐terminal kinase  JNK and p   pathways  as well as activating NF‐κB  Ahmed et al.       . The two partners essentially feed off each other in a continuous cycle  hence the attenuation of oxidative stress may lead to the reduction in inflammatory processes and vice versa—a major target of many therapeutic interventions. Apple polyphenols have been shown to exhibit these properties in vitro  in animal models  and in clinical trials of chronic inflammatory diseases  Farzaei et al.       . For instance  the amelioration of postprandial inflammation by the intake of ‘Gala’ apples was demonstrated recently to occur via the reduction of pro‐inflammatory cytokines  IFN‐γ  IL‐   and TNF‐α  Liddle et al.       . Additionally  using the grass carp fish  Yang et al.        reported the diminishing of the intestinal inflammatory response by the suppression of TLR  signaling and transcription of IL‐ β  IL‐   and TNF‐α genes following apple polyphenols supplementation.  . . Gastro‐intestinal tract  GIT  protection by apple consumption Another major mechanism employed by apple constituents to improve human health is through their activities on the human gut microbiota. Apple proanthocyanidins and the pectin fiber have been particularly shown to interact with the gut microbiota  modulating its composition to achieve beneficial outcomes  Garcia‐Mazcorro et al.        Koutsos et al.       . For example  the decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio accompanied by a rise in Akkermansia in the cecum was attributed to the intake of apple procyanidins and was shown to prevent obesity in mice  Masumoto et al.       . The anti‐inflammatory effects of apples related to the alleviation of metabolic syndrome are purportedly due to the modulation of the gut microbiota. In this regard  pectin was reported to stimulate the commensal bacteria  Faecalibacterium prausnitzii  in the human colon that possesses anti‐inflammatory actions  Chung et al.        Garcia‐Mazcorro et al.       .  . . Apple consumption against type   diabetes and obesity Type   diabetes  T D a chronic metabolic disease with a complex etiology and multifarious pathogenesis  is prevalent among adults with an estimated more than half a billion patients expected by       International Diabetes Federation       . Although antidiabetic therapeutics are available with varying degrees of efficacy  diet and exercise have been proven to play major roles in the management of T D  Magkos et al.       . Apple supplementation in the diet of diabetic or obese rodents  Ogura et al.        Tamura et al.        and in vitro experiments  de Oliveira Raphaelli et al.        D. Li et al.        indicated an amelioration of the diabetic indices measured. These antidiabetic actions  mostly attributed to the polyphenol constituent  were reported to occur through the induction of beige adipocyte development in inguinal white adipose tissue. Other mechanisms include alleviation of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia  reduction of excess oxidative stress and inflammation  and inhibition of α‐glucosidase enzyme activity. In the analysis of three prospective longitudinal studies involving almost         total participants  higher consumption of whole apple  grape  or blueberry fruits was linked to a reduced risk of developing T D  Muraki et al.       . With obesity  a major predisposing factor to the development of T D  the ability of apples—a low glycemic index fruit  to decrease weight gain through its antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities  as well as actions on important signal transduction pathways has been highlighted  Asgary et al.       .  . . Apple supplementation to manage cancer Cancer continues to present a great cause of health and economic burden to humans  occupying the second position in the global cause of mortality ranking and projected to overtake ischemic heart disease for the first position by       Mattiuzzi   Lippi       . Polyphenol‐rich fruits or plant extracts have been suggested to help in the chemopreventive medicines niche due to their multifaceted medicinal modes of action targeted at preventing carcinogenesis  Oyenihi   Smith       . The regular consumption of apples has shown beneficial effects on many types of cancer. Apple polyphenols  flavonoids  Chang et al.       phloretin  Lin et al.       and polysaccharides  Y. H. Li et al.        were reported to alleviate colorectal cancer endpoints. In the azoxymethane  rat carcinogenesis  model  apple anthocyanin—cyanidin‐ ‐O‐galactoside—was recently demonstrated to reduce the appearance of the precancer indices assessed in the study  Bars‐Cortina et al.       . The purported modes of action against cancer include cell cycle arrest  inhibition of cell migration and invasion  apoptosis  anti‐angiogenesis  anti‐inflammatory  and antioxidant  Tu et al.       . Phloretin from apples may be an important anticancer phytochemical based on the results obtained in experiments on the breast  Wu et al.       prostrate  Kim et al.       cervical  Hsiao et al.       lung  esophageal  gastric  and blood cancers  Choi       .  . . Apple consumption for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases Cardiovascular diseases  CVDs  including coronary heart disease  stroke  atherosclerosis  hypertension  cerebrovascular  and so on  remain the number one health challenge and cause of mortality globally and accounted for close to    million deaths in      alone  Virani et al.       . This huge health burden  therefore  warrants urgent disease‐management approaches to lower the prevalence and mortality. Dietary flavonoids were shown to exert an inverse relationship with CVD‐associated mortality in prospective cohort studies supporting the recommendation that the regular consumption of fruit and vegetables may help in reducing the risk of developing CVD  Kim   Je       . The intake of apples decreased atherogenic cholesterol levels  Chai et al.       enhanced endothelial function  Bondonno et al.       and decreased the bone mass index  Gayer et al.        in clinical trials. These collective research findings could be crucial in preventing CVD. It has been suggested that the modulation of the gut microbiota by apples should be considered a major link to its ability to reduce CVD risk markers  Koutsos et al.       .  . ADVANCES IN HURDLE TECHNIQUES FOR APPLES Various conventional hurdle techniques have been demonstrated over the years to maintain the quality of fresh fruit and retain the bioactive/nutritional compounds  Mahajan et al.        Nyamende et al.       . Hurdle technologies ensure the freshness of the fruit  through microbial inactivation that occurs via a multiphase approach involving milder but synergistically/combinatorial effects of techniques  Ross et al.       . Techniques can be physical  chemical  or biological  Figure   . The correct selection of a specific approach or combination of hurdle techniques can ensure microbial safety  stability  and quality  Pinela   Ferreira       . FIGURE   Technologies to extend the shelf‐life of fresh apple during postharvest However  new hurdle techniques that often have an overarching focus on safety  microbial or chemical residue/toxins due to public health and cross‐contamination concerns are emerging. Thus  this section discusses the advancement in hurdle technique for apples and highlights the unintended consequences on nutritional quality degradation during handling and storage.  . . Physical hurdles Effective control and management of fresh apples along the supply chain using physical hurdle techniques  especially cold decontamination  is one of the most promising areas of approach  Pietrysiak et al.       . Cold storage temperature alone or in combination with other conventional techniques such as chemical and heat pretreatments have been used as a shelf‐life extension mechanism  Kabelitz et al.        Ranjbar et al.       . Under low‐temperature storage  most of the biochemical processes that have detrimental effects on the fruit quality can be delayed  which enhances the storage life. However  not all fruits favor low‐temperature storage  and apple fruit is prone to chilling injury and browning during storage below the optimum temperature  Watkins   Liu       . Emerging knowledge in the area of packaging systems and nonthermal technologies for postharvest management of apple fruit has been reported to show beneficial effects in comparison to conventional approaches  Moreira et al.       . Controlled or modified atmosphere tools and active packaging systems  that can absorb or adsorb gases  moisture  and those that release bioactive compounds  and edible films/coating have been extensively reported as shelf‐life extension strategies for apples  da Rocha Neto et al.        Khalifa et al.        Mditshwa et al.       . These techniques have been used in combination with cold storage as a natural alternative to extend the shelf‐life of apples  Khalifa et al.       . Furthermore  various nonthermal technologies such as pulsed electric field  PEF irradiation  ozone  pulsed light  PL ultra‐sound  US short‐wave ultraviolet light  UV‐C and high hydrostatic pressure  HHP  have been demonstrated to be effective decontaminants of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in apple fruit  Grimi et al.        Manzocco et al.        Moreira et al.        Ribas‐Agustí et al.        Salem   Moussa        Wu et al.       . However  in some cases  suboptimal or excessive use of these treatments alone can have detrimental effects on the quality of the apples  Table   . Hence  it is recommended to combine these tools with dipping treatments using ascorbic acid  citric acid  and calcium chloride to minimize browning and for a better shelf‐life  Gómez et al.        Salem   Moussa        Wu et al.       . Furthermore  the application of the edible coating in combination with the nonthermal techniques for extending the shelf‐life of fruits is emerging  Moreira et al.        Moreira et al.       . It is also worth mentioning that the previously‐mentioned nonthermal technologies have limitation for an in‐depth treatment of opaque substances due to absorption and scattering of light and therefore  is only suitable to control surface microflora  Gómez et al.        Manzocco et al.       .

Hyperbaric pressure	Up to    –    MPa	 Affects cell structure Makes the cell more permeable Increases diffusion Enhances the uptake of biologically active substances High pressure results in tissue softening and microstructure change due to cell damage	 Fernández‐Jalao et al.        George et al.

Cold plasma	 The species existing in the thermodynamic equilibrium are in thermal nonequilibrium state  e.g.  glow discharges  electron temperature ≈       –        K  heavier species temperature ≈    –     K Decontamination properties  effective against major food‐borne microbes such as  Salmonella typhimurium  Staphylococcus aureus  and Listeria monocytogenes	 Effectiveness depends on the output discharge  fruit exposure time  and the gas used. The high oxidative action of gases could affect the biochemical nature of the fruit.  Ukuku et al.        Electrolyzed water  EW 	Generated by the electrolysis of a diluted   . – .  salt  NaCl  solution with the product of anode   and cathode  ‐  solution.	 Effective in reducing or eliminating pathogenic microbes and their surrogates such as E. coli  L. innocua  and S. choleraesuis on apple slices. Total microorganism population size does not affect the effectiveness of EW Low adverse impact on the environment and possibly on human health Only surface sanitization/decontamination effect on whole apple fruit.	 Graça et al.        The application of electromagnetic waves as decontamination is beneficial especially for internal defects that need a treatment  which can penetrate the depth of the fruit. In this aspect  the use of microwave  MW  could have potential by creating volumetric heating  Gamage et al.       . The potential of MW     –    Kj/kg  treatment as an alternative to chemical treatment during storage to control Bactrocera tryoni  Froggatt and Bactrocera jarvisi was demonstrated for ‘Granny Smith’ apples  Gamage et al.       . The authors further suggested that the application of mild heating along with other treatments  hot air  have more benefit than MW alone. Furthermore  during MW treatment of a whole fruit  uneven heating is unavoidable due to the fruit structure and thermal properties. For a complete nonthermal technique  pulses UV  PUV  and UV‐C have been shown having great advantage with a short treatment duration      s Ferrario   Guerrero       . For maximum effectiveness of UV‐C treatment  factors such as the presence of dispersing reflector as well as ensuring the uniform exposure of fruit must be considered  Manzocco et al.       . Ultrasound is another emerging nonthermal postharvest treatment used to extend the shelf‐life of fresh apples  Ferrario   Guerrero       . Ultrasound treatment is categorized as a nontoxic  safer  and environmentally friendly approach  but  its efficiency against microbial inactivation needs integration with other treatments such as chemical  heat  and pressure  Ferrario   Guerrero       . In addition to electromagnetic and sound energy in the postharvest shelf‐life extension on apples  the use of hyperbaric pressure also emerged as a potential alternative to chemical and thermal treatments  George et al.       . High‐pressure treatment is effective to eliminate pests on the fruit surface during postharvest processing of apples  Fernández‐Jalao et al.       . Table   presents the selected nonthermal postharvest treatments reported for shelf‐life extension of apple fruit during postharvest.  . . Natural compounds Decontamination of apple fruit surface after harvest has been heavily dependent on fungicides or chlorinated water treatment. This practice has an impact on fruit quality and human health  and has resulted in the development of resistant strains  Li   Xiao       . Essential oils  EOs  are one of the most promising plant metabolites  that are biologically safe  biodegradable in nature  and with a low risk to cause pathogen resistance  da Rocha Neto et al.        Hu et al.       . Treatment of apples with EOs to prevent the growth of Penicillium expansum and Botrytis cinerea has been reported as an effective approach  Frankova et al.       . Banani et al.        reported significantly lower gray mold incidence and severity due to B. cinerea for “Red Fuji” apples treated with thyme and savory Eos  respectively. However  the efficacy of EOs depends on the natural resistance of the apple cultivar  length of storage  and method of application  dipping/spraying Lopez‐Reyes et al.       . The drawbacks of some EOs are their strong aroma and the volatility of active compounds  which might affect the organoleptic quality and storage life of the product  Ribeiro‐Santos et al.       . In this case  the combination of EOs with other postharvest treatments such as hot air  Frankova et al.       as well as hurdle approach to maintaining a controlled‐release incorporated EOs with packaging  films/coating  is advantageous  Guerreiro et al.       . Decontamination using chemical or surface treatments for apple fruit can ensure the low or inhibited growth of microbes on the surface of the fruit  however  combining them with electromagnetic or sound and pressure treatments can ensure the inhibition of microbes on the pericarp and mesocarp of the fruit  Salem   Moussa       .  . . Biological controls Biological control is a promising alternative to chemical and heat treatments for a more naturally preserved apple fruit without detrimental effects on the quality  Dukare et al.        Quaglia et al.       . Currently  available biological control agents for apple fruit postharvest decay management include various bacteria  yeast  and filamentous fungi  Castoria et al.        Nadai et al.       . The application of microbial antagonists can be performed by pulverization or immersion in solution  Carmona‐Hernandez et al.       . Most of the microbial antagonists are naturally present on fruit and vegetable surfaces or they can be obtained from sources such as roots and soils  Droby et al.        Dukare et al.       . The main mechanisms of antagonists against phytopathogens are by suppressing or interfering with the normal growth due to competition for space and nutrients  biofilms  parasitism  and by producing inhibitory metabolites  Dukare et al.        Wallace et al.       . Common types of pathogenic molds that affect the shelf‐life of apples include blue and grey mold and ring and brown rot caused by Penicillium expansum  Botrytis cinerea  Botryosphaeria dothidea  and Monilina functigena  respectively  Li   Xiao        Quaglia et al.       . However  P. expansum is the most aggressive  Mostafavi et al.        and widely studied compared to the others inhibited by biocontrol agents so far  Czarnecka et al.        Mari et al.        Nadai et al.        Quaglia et al.        Vero et al.        Wallace et al.       . In addition  P. expansum produces mycotoxins  such as patulin  that causes serious health problem for consumers  Nadai et al.       . The positive synergetic effect of various microbial antagonists such as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PG    Chen et al.       Paenibacillus polymyxa APEC    and B. subtilis APEC     Kim et al.        and B. subtilis       Fan et al.        have been reported for apple fruit. More recently  the beneficial effects of other antagonistics including Starmerella bacillaris  Nadai et al.       Debaryomyces hansenii  and Wickerhamomyces anomalus  Czarnecka et al.       and various yeast isolates  Madbouly et al.        have shown a beneficial effect as a biocontrol of postharvest pathogens of apple fruit. Table   presents the list of antagonists as a biocontrol against various molds that affect the shelf‐life of apples during postharvest.

Nunes       . According to the previously mentioned studies  the inhibition/biocontrol efficacy of the antagonistic yeasts  pathogenic fungus  or bacteria could be depending on the pH  relative humidity  prolonged cultivation of microorganisms  or successful colonization  biofilm formation and swarming motility . Furthermore  biocontrol efficacy of yeast can be influenced by oxidative stress and incorporating an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid can induce stress tolerance and biocontrol efficacy of antagonistic yeast  Li et al.       . In addition  the effectiveness of antagonistic yeast  P. guilliemondii  against P. expansum  B. cinerea  and C. gloesporioides was improved by combining it with hot water    °C  treatment for ‘Red Fuji’ apple  Zhao   Yin       . The development of biocontrol  however  is a tedious process requiring a detailed knowledge of several disease factors such as pathogen  host  disease epidemiology  constitutive or induced host resistance  and the environmental condition  Droby et al.        Nunes       . Though the application of EOs and biocontrols have been proven as effective methods to control the postharvest pathogens of apples  however  at higher concentrations  and depending on the application methods or frequency of treatments  phytotoxic tendencies have been reported  Lopez‐Reyes et al.       . Therefore  cautious advancements are required to avoid the determinate effects of the hurdle approach on the quality of the fruit.  . CONCLUSION The value of apple fruit and the role of its bioactive constituents in the delivery of essential micro‐ and phyto‐nutrients to humans cannot be overemphasized. The multitargeted and multilevel pharmacological actions of its vitamins  minerals  and polyphenols especially against chronic diseases could indeed “keep the doctor away.” Thus  research strategies that prioritize the medicinal value of apples from the farm gate to consumer plate should be actively promoted. Therefore  as efforts to maintain fresh fruit safety and control biohazards heighten in the wake of the global COVID‐   pandemic  it is important to balance these activities with access to nutritional fruit. Advancements in the application of hurdle techniques such as the use of cold plasma  electrolyzed water  nano‐bubbles  high pressure  ultrasounds  and superheated steam/vapor for apples should include nutritional quality considerations. Further research is needed on the impact of these emerging tools on bioactive compounds of fresh apples during storage and the entire supply chain. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Ayodeji B.

In France  it is the most consumed edible fruit and the third in the planet. The main types of apples come from the domestic apple or common apple. The species of Malus Domestica has about        varieties and cultivars around the world. The fruit has a characteristic stocky shape and often spherical  it is eaten when ripe  raw  cooked  or dried. Its juice is drunk fresh or pasteurized. When fermented  it becomes cider. Associated with the fruit forbidden in the Book of Genesis  it often symbolizes original sin. The fruit we consume today is descended from the Malus Sieversii species  it has been consumed by humans since the Neolithic age in the Central. Kazakhstan claims its origin  but the apple was already consumed by the Chinese       years ago. From a botanical point of view  it is a complex fruit  something between the berry and the drupe  often called a false fruit. Because a real fruit is formed from the ovary of a flower. An apple s flesh is not derived from the ovary but instead it is a swollen receptacle  or part of the stem . The actual fruit is in the core  the bit we throw away. The same is true of pears. Its colors at maturity change from green to red  passing through a wide variety of intermediate shades  pale green  yellow  or orange. The success of this fruit is undisputed  because today there are more than        varieties of apples of which       are regularly cultivated across the globe. China  the United States and Poland are the three largest producers of apples. China harvests    million tons  the United States  .  million tons and Poland  .  million tons. The EU is also one of the leading producers  has increased its production by     on average for the past three years. France harvests  .  million tons.  Health Benefits of Apples Apples are crunchy  sweet  or tart  and satisfying. As part of a nutrient dense diet  they can help protect against serious diseases  including heart disease  diabetes  cancer and more. apple peanut butter with cinnamon Apples are crunchy  sweet  or tart  and satisfying. As part of a nutrient dense diet  they can help protect against serious diseases  including heart disease  diabetes  cancer and more. You know the old saying   An apple a day keeps the doctor away.  Turns out there s more truth to that than you might think. Studies show apples have powerful health benefits  particularly when it comes to fighting chronic diseases that kill millions of people each year. So powerful are components found in apples  that a      study in Antioxidants shows that researchers are looking for ways to include apples in health care products for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by inflammation. Here are a few reasons why eating more apples can help keep you healthy  along with some apple licious ways to add them to your meals. Apple Nutrition The nutrition varies slightly between the different apple varieties  but not all that much. Here s the nutrition breakdown for one medium apple  per the USDA.    calories   g protein   g fat    g carbohydrates   g fiber   mg vitamin C    IU vitamin A     mg potassium Apples are high in water content—they re about     water—and rich in fiber  a medium apple contains   grams or about     of your daily value two things you need to feel full. Apples have one other feel full benefit  They take time to eat. Foods you can gobble down quickly tend to leave you hungry  so you end up eating more. Apples also have a low glycemic index  which means your blood sugar levels don t spike when you eat them. So while a rosy Red Delicious or sunny Honeycrisp might taste amazingly sweet  your body is able to process the sugar in a manageable way. And because apples are both sweet and filling  snacking on an apple can be a smart way to respond to cravings. Just be sure to eat the whole fruit  peel and all  as the peel also contains fiber and nutrients. In fact  a      study in Foods showed that the peel of Fuji apples contributes to     of the apple s total flavonoid content and     of the phenolic content of the entire apple  flavonoids and phenols have antioxidant properties . Health Benefits of Apples  . Protects Your Heart Apple Cinnamon Quinoa Bowl Pictured Recipe  Apple Cinnamon Quinoa Bowl Multiple studies show apples are good for your ticker in many ways. In a large      review in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition  researchers combed through    studies that looked at apple consumption and cardiovascular disease  CVD  risk. They found that whole apple consumption was associated with a reduced risk of dying from CVD  ischemic heart disease  stroke  severe abdominal aortic calcification  as well as dying from anything. Specifically  these researchers found that whole apple consumption reduced total cholesterol  LDL cholesterol   bad  cholesterol systolic blood pressure  pulse pressure and plasma inflammatory cytokines. In turn  apple consumption can increase HDL cholesterol  the helpful form of cholesterol. These researchers state that these findings are based on     g to     g of apple consumption a day  which is about two medium sized apples.  . Boosts Brain Health In a      study published in Nutrients  Swedish researchers following       people for six years found that those who stuck to a diet called the Nordic Prudent Dietary Pattern  NPDP  had better cognitive function than people who ate more fatty  processed foods. Among other things  the NPDP calls for eating plenty of non root vegetables  plus pears  peaches and—you guessed it—apples. In a      study in Alzheimer s Research and Therapy  older adults who followed the MIND diet—a fusion of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet  both of which stress eating fresh fruits and vegetables—had a lower risk of developing dementia. Experts point out that more research is needed  but the results look promising. Looking more specifically at components in foods like apples  tea and berries       research in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people with low intake of foods with high levels of antioxidant like components had higher rates of Alzheimer s disease  AD  and Alzheimer s disease and related dementias  ADRD . Specifically  a low intake of components called flavonoid polymers  found in apples  pears and tea  was associated with twice the risk of developing ADRD. Similar results were found regarding AD.  . May Help You Lose Weight oats and nuts on blue floral plate Pictured Recipe  Apple Crisp Stuffed Baked Apples One medium apple can help fill you up for under     calories  so it s no surprise that apples can help with weight loss. A      review in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition shows many associations between apple consumption and weight loss. The compounds in apples also help feed healthy gut bacteria  potentially lowering the risk of some obesity related problems. Prebiotics in apples have been shown to feed good gut bacteria. For example  a      lab study published in Agriculture looked at whether components in apple peels  as well as banana and mango peels  could act as prebiotics. Results suggest that these peels all increased certain types of beneficial gut bacteria  by providing food for them.  . Lowers Risk of Type   Diabetes A      meta analysis published in Current Developments in Nutrition that included a total of         participants over several studies  suggests that regularly eating apples  pears or a combination of the two can lower your risk of developing type   diabetes. An interesting      study in Foods suggests that eating an apple prior to a meal can lower postprandial  after eating  blood glucose levels in people with impaired glucose tolerance  pre diabetes . And a      review in Food   Function suggests that eating apples and pears might reduce the risk of developing type   diabetes by    . Even eating just one apple or pear a week reduced the risk by   . A      systematic review in BMJ Nutrition Prevention   Health also suggests that a high intake of apples and other fruit  including pears  blueberries  grapefruit and grapes  is related to about a    reduced risk of type   diabetes.  . Fights Cancer containers Pictured Recipe  Turkey Apple Brie Sandwiches Including apples in your diet is linked with a lower risk of several cancers. For example  a      review in Nutrients looked at studies that found that the consumption of apples seems to be related to a reduced risk of lung  bladder  breast  pancreatic  colorectal  pharynx  esophagus  ovary  renal and prostate cancers. That s a lot of protection in that one fruit  In addition to preventing cancers  researchers state that the phytochemicals in apples can also help slow down the progression of cancer. Just make sure you re eating the whole fruit and not tossing the peel—that s where many of the cancer fighting antioxidants are found. The Bottom Line Like any other food  apples are not a magic bullet for all things health. But including them regularly in your diet  along with other fruits and vegetables  may allow you to reap many of the health benefits shown here. And while we love eating apples as is  we also love including them in our recipes  like Sausage Stuffed Apples  Curried Chicken Apple Wraps or Roasted Squash   Apples with Dried Cherries   Pepitas. You can also simply dice and toss them into your salads. Some original reporting by Kerri Ann Jennings  M.S.  R.D.Health Benefits of Apples Parlee Farms ‘Pick your own apples’ season is in full swing at Parlee Farms in Tyngsboro  MA. We know that our apples are delicious eaten fresh and they are also wonderful when used for baking. There are also plenty of health benefits associated with apples  We all have heard the popular saying  “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” and as it turns out  the saying is true. Here are some health benefits of this delicious fruit  Apples Are Good for You  Apples are not only delicious  but they are also highly nutritious. They are low in calories  have a good amount of fiber  and their own natural sweetness. They are also good sources of potassium  Vitamin C  Vitamin K  and also contain smaller amounts of manganese  B vitamins  Vitamin A  and Vitamin E. They Can Help with Weight Loss There have been studies that have shown that apples may help assist with weight loss. Not only is it a delicious and satisfying fruit that is low in calories  but it seems that there might be other reasons why apples can help facilitate weight loss  such as its fiber content. In this study  for example  fifty overweight women added the fruit to their diets and it sped up their weight loss success. Encourage Heart Health Besides all the vitamins and minerals that are present in apples  this fruit also contains polyphenols  which are micronutrients that act as an antioxidant. It is because of these polyphenols that apples are known for helping to keep the heart healthy. Experience a Decreased Risk of Diabetes Did you know that apples have also been associated with lowering the risk of diabetes? There have been several studies that have shown this  and experts believe that this is also due to the high levels of polyphenols that are present in apples. These polyphenols may help the body better produce insulin  which can help prevent this Type II diabetes from developing in the body. Apples are also delicious  In order to get the full health benefits of apples  you might want to consider eating them fresh picked. Do you want to pick your own?

Researchers actually put the old adage to the test a few years ago  using nutrition data from nearly       people — including     who said they ate an apple every day. But while daily apple eaters appeared to use fewer prescription medications  they weren’t less likely to go to health care appointments than the other people in the study. But in       an article in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition that included    studies involving apple consumption found an array of heart related benefits. Eating one medium apple a day may help lower blood pressure  cholesterol  and inflammation  the authors concluded. Unpeeled apples are good sources of both fiber and compounds called polyphenols that benefit heart health. Popular apple varieties include Red Delicious  McIntosh  Fuji  Gala  and Honeycrisp  but more than     varieties are grown commercially in this country. Store apples in your refrigerator to keep them fresh. Apples are handy  nutritious snacks  especially paired with peanut butter or low fat cheese. But you can also tuck chunks or slices of these crisp fruits in all sorts of dishes  including whole grain pancakes  sandwiches  and salads.An apple is a round  edible fruit produced by an apple tree  Malus spp.  among them the domestic or orchard apple  Malus domestica . Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia  where its wild ancestor  Malus sieversii  is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures  including Norse  Greek  and European Christian tradition. Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents  and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes  including botanical evaluation  apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree  allowing for easier harvesting. There are more than       cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses  including cooking  eating raw  and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal  bacterial  and pest problems  which can be controlled by a number of organic and non organic means. In       the fruit s genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. From      to       there have been an average of    million tonnes of apples globally produced per year. In       the worldwide production of apples was    million tonnes  with China accounting for nearly half of the total. Etymology The word apple  whose Old English ancestor is æppel  is descended from the Proto Germanic noun  aplaz  descended in turn from Proto Indo European  h₂ébōl. As late as the   th century  the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit  including nuts. This can be compared to the   th century Middle English expression appel of paradis  meaning a banana. Description The apple is a deciduous tree  generally standing   to  .  metres    to    feet  tall in cultivation and up to   m     ft  in the wild. When cultivated  the size  shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides. Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The   to   centimeter    to   ⁄  inch  flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades  five petaled  with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with  –  flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the  king bloom   it opens first and can develop a larger fruit. The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn  and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is   to  .  cm    ⁄  to   ⁄  in  in diameter  due to market preference. Some consumers  especially in Japan  prefer a larger apple  while apples less than  .  cm    ⁄  in  are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value. Apple blossoms Apple blossoms Botanical illustration Apple morphology Skin The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow  green  yellow green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange red  pink red  red  purple red or brown red. The overcolor amount can be  –    . The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted  i.e. rough and brown . The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax. The exocarp  flesh  is generally pale yellowish white  though pink  yellow or green exocarps also occur. Chemistry Important volatile compounds in apples include acetaldehyde  ethyl acetate    butanal  ethanol    methylbutanal    methylbutanal  ethyl propionate  ethyl   methylpropionate  ethyl butyrate  ethyl   methyl butyrate  hexanal    butanol    methylbutyl acetate    methylbutyl acetate    propyl butyrate  ethyl pentanoate  amyl acetate    methyl   butanol  trans   hexenal  ethyl hexanoate  hexanol. Taxonomy The apple as a species has been given a number of alternative scientific names  or synonyms. In modern times  Malus pumila and Malus domestica are the two main names in use. M. pumila is the older name  but M. domestica has become much more commonly used starting in the   st century  especially in the western world. Two proposals were made to make M. domestica a conserved name  the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular Plants of the IAPT in       but in April      the Committee decided  with a narrow majority  that the newly popular name should be conserved. The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June      to approve this change  officially conserving M. domestica. Nevertheless  a number of publications published after      still use M. pumila as the correct name  under an alternate taxonomy. Wild ancestors The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii  found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Tajikistan  and northwestern China. Cultivation of the species  most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains  progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris  the crabapple  resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates. Genome Apples are diploid  though triploid cultivars are not uncommon have    chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately     Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in      was based on the diploid cultivar  Golden Delicious . However  this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain several errors in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which  in combination with an ancient genome duplication  complicated the assembly. Recently  double  and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced  yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality. The first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around        genes  though the more recent genome sequences support estimates between        and        protein coding genes. The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this  while also suggesting extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following domestication. Distribution and habitat Central Asia is generally considered the center of origin for apples due to the genetic variability in specimens there. Cultivation History The apple is thought to have been domesticated      –       years ago in the Tian Shan mountains  and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe  with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia  M. baccata the Caucasus  M. orientalis and Europe  M. sylvestris . Only the M. sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple  not the isolated population on the eastern side. Chinese soft apples  such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia  have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than       years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in Kazakhstan. Among the traits selected for by human growers are size  fruit acidity  color  firmness  and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits  the wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple. At the Sammardenchia Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy  seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to around      BCE. Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus sieversii ancestry. It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations. There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial apple production in the European classical antiquity  and grafting was certainly known then. Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production  to be able to propagate the best cultivars  it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented. Winter apples  picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing  have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia. Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the   th century  apple trees became particularly well adapted. Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the   th century  and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in     . The only apples native to North America are crab apples  which were once called  common apples . Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes  as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An      United States apples nursery catalogue sold     of the  best  cultivars  showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early   th century. In the   th century  irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion dollar fruit industry  of which the apple is the leading product. Until the   th century  farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage. Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity  low oxygen  and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in the     s. Breeding See also  Fruit tree propagation and Malling series Many apples grow readily from seeds. However  more than with most perennial fruits  apples must be propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of  extreme heterozygotes   in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics  they are instead significantly different from their parents  perhaps to compete with the many pests. Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis  yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes  aneuploids . Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed  apples are an example it occurs infrequently  and seedlings rarely survive. Because apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds  although cuttings can take root and breed true  and may live for a century  grafting is usually used. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes  as well as changing the winter hardiness  insect and disease resistance  and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees  less than  .  m or    ft high at maturity which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees  and are easier to harvest. Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as     BCE  to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle s Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the   th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world. The majority of the rootstocks used to control size in apples were developed in England in the early     s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks  and their rootstocks are given an  M  prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an  MM  prefix are Malling series cultivars later crossed with trees of  Northern Spy  in Merton  England. Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings  which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics. The words  seedling    pippin   and  kernel  in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports  mutations on a single branch . Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars. Since the     s  the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown  both commercially and by local orchardists  throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included  Haralson   which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota  Wealthy    Honeygold   and  Honeycrisp . Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes  where they can often  with the needed factors  provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year round. Pollination See also  Fruit tree pollination Apples are self incompatible  they must cross pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each season  apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards  but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators. Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average    day blossom period  with pollinizers selected from cultivars within a   day overlap period. There are four to seven pollination groups in apples  depending on climate  Group A – Early flowering    to   May in England   Gravenstein    Red Astrachan   Group B –   to   May   Idared    McIntosh   Group C – Mid season flowering    to    May   Granny Smith    Cox s Orange Pippin   Group D – Mid/late season flowering     to    May   Golden Delicious    Calville blanc d hiver   Group E – Late flowering     to    May   Braeburn    Reinette d Orléans   Group F –    to    May   Suntan   Group H –    to    May   Court Pendu Gris  – also called Court Pendu plat  One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close  A with A  or A with B  but not A with C or D . Maturation and harvest See also  Fruit picking and Fruit tree pruning Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree  even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars  if left unpruned  grow very large—letting them bear more fruit  but making harvesting more difficult. Depending on tree density  number of trees planted per unit surface area mature trees typically bear   –    kg    –    lb  of apples each year  though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about   –   kg    –    lb  of fruit per year. Some farms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples. Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include  Gala    Golden Supreme    McIntosh    Transparent    Primate    Sweet Bough   and  Duchess   fall producers include  Fuji    Jonagold    Golden Delicious    Red Delicious    Chenango    Gravenstein    Wealthy    McIntosh    Snow   and  Blenheim   winter producers include  Winesap    Granny Smith    King    Wagener    Swayzie    Greening   and  Tolman Sweet . Storage Commercially  apples can be stored for a few months in controlled atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. For home storage  most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator  i.e. below   °C . Some can be stored up to a year without significant degradation. dubious – discuss  verification needed  Some varieties of apples  e.g.  Granny Smith  and  Fuji   have more than three times the storage life of others. Non organic apples may be sprayed with a substance   methylcyclopropene blocking the apples  ethylene receptors  temporarily preventing them from ripening. Pests and diseases Main article  List of apple diseases Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality  tree health  and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides  though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include  for instance  introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest. A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew  aphids  and apple scab. Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves  shoots and flowers  normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions. Aphids are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples  apple grain aphid  rosy apple aphid  apple aphid  spirea aphid  and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color  time of year  and by differences in the cornicles  small paired projections from their rear . Aphids feed on foliage using needle like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers  certain species reduce tree growth and vigor. Apple scab  Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit  which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year s growth. Among the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called fireblight  and three fungal diseases  Gymnosporangium rust  black spot  and bitter rot. Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer  which feed on the soft bark of the trees  especially in winter. The larvae of the apple clearwing moth  red belted clearwing  burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees  potentially causing significant damage. Cultivars Main article  List of apple cultivars There are more than       known cultivars  cultivated varieties  of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree  even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK s National Fruit Collection  which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment  Food  and Rural Affairs  includes a collection of over       cultivars of apple tree in Kent. The University of Reading  which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database  provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading s work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are    countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group. The UK s national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples  including alternative names for what is essentially the same  genetic  apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh  dessert apples though some are cultivated specifically for cooking  cooking apples  or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh  but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot. Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin  absence of russeting  ease of shipping  lengthy storage ability  high yields  disease resistance  common apple shape  and developed flavor. Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars  as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet  subacid apples  but tart apples have a strong minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia  especially the Indian subcontinent. Old cultivars are often oddly shaped  russeted  and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars  but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield  disease susceptibility  poor tolerance for storage or transport  or just being the  wrong  size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale  but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist  apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom  old cultivars such as  Cox s Orange Pippin  and  Egremont Russet  are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.  Ambrosia   Ananasrenette   Arkansas Black   Aroma   Belle de Boskoop   Bramley   Cox s Orange Pippin   Cox Pomona   Cripps Pink   Discovery   Egremont Russet   Fuji   Gala   Gloster   Golden Delicious   Goldrenette   Reinette   Granny Smith   Honeycrisp   James Grieve   Jonagold   Lobo   McIntosh   Sciros   Red Delicious   Sampion   Shampion   Stark Delicious   SugarBee   Summerred   Summerred   Tellissaare   Yellow Transparent   Yellow Transparent  Production Main article  List of countries by apple production World production of apples in      was    million tonnes  with China producing     of the total  table . Secondary producers were the United States and Turkey. Toxicity Apple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin  a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects  but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect  as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The U.S. National Library of Medicine s Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds. Allergy One form of apple allergy  often found in northern Europe  is called birch apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen  and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits  nuts  and vegetables. Reactions  which entail oral allergy syndrome  OAS generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat  but in rare cases can also include life threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple  maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch apple syndrome. In other areas  such as the Mediterranean  some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS  but often has more severe symptoms  such as vomiting  abdominal pain and urticaria  and can be life threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction  so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested  over ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction. Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy. Uses See also  Cooking apple and Cider apple Nutrition A raw apple is     water and     carbohydrates  with negligible content of fat and protein  table . A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing     grams provides    calories and a moderate content of dietary fiber. Otherwise  there is low content of micronutrients  with the Daily Values of all falling below    . Culinary All parts of the fruit  including the skin  except for the seeds  are suitable for human consumption. The core  from stem to bottom  containing the seeds  is usually not eaten and is discarded. Apples can be consumed in various ways  juice  raw in salads  baked in pies  cooked into sauces and spreads like apple butter  and other baked dishes. Apples are sometimes used as an ingredient in savory foods  such as sausage and stuffing. Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products. Apples can be canned  dried or frozen. Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen. Apples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples. Apples also figure into many traditional or festival occasions. In the UK  a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples  coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup  and caramel apples  coated with cooled caramel  and are usually consumed during the autumn season or Halloween. Apples and honey are a ritual food pairing eaten during the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year. Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts  such as apple pie  apple crumble  apple crisp and apple cake. When cooked  some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are often baked or stewed and are also  cooked  in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted  soaked in water  alcohol or some other liquid . Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice  which may be drunk unfiltered  called apple cider in North America or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen  then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be fermented to make cider  called hard cider in North America ciderkin  and vinegar. Through distillation  various alcoholic beverages can be produced  such as applejack  Calvados  and apfelwein. Organic production Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases  organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals  such as sulfur  copper  microorganisms  viruses  clay powders  or plant extracts  pyrethrum  neem  has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin  which forms a physical barrier to some pests  also may help prevent apple sun scalding. Phytochemicals Apple skins and seeds contain various phytochemicals  particularly polyphenols. Non browning apples The enzyme polyphenol oxidase causes browning in sliced or bruised apples  by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o quinones  a browning factor. Browning reduces apple taste  color  and food value. Arctic apples  a non browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in       have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase  thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality. The US Food and Drug Administration in       and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in       determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples. Other products Apple seed oil is obtained by pressing apple seeds for manufacturing cosmetics. In culture Main article  Apple  symbolism  Germanic paganism In Norse mythology  the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda  written in the   th century by Snorri Sturluson  as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism  from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway  that fruit and nuts  Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál  have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe  which may have had a symbolic meaning  and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England. Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir  a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology  citing an instance of eleven  golden apples  being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir  who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas    and    of Skírnismál. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter   of the Völsunga saga  when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child  Frigg s messenger  in the guise of a crow  drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound. Rerir s wife s consumption of the apple results in a six year pregnancy and the birth  by Caesarean section  of their son—the hero Völsung. Further  Davidson points out the  strange  phrase  Apples of Hel  used in an   th century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further  Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East  the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn  we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol  that of the guardian goddess of the life giving fruit of the other world.  Greek mythology Apples appear in many religious traditions  often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion  mythology and folktales is that the word  apple  was used as a generic term for all  foreign  fruit  other than berries  including nuts  as late as the   th century. For instance  in Greek mythology  the Greek hero Heracles  as a part of his Twelve Labours  was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center. The Greek goddess of discord  Eris  became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In retaliation  she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη  Kalliste  sometimes transliterated Kallisti   For the most beautiful one  into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple  Hera  Athena  and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena  Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world  Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite  thus indirectly causing the Trojan War. The apple was thus considered  in ancient Greece  sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one s love  and similarly  to catch it was to symbolically show one s acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states  I throw the apple at you  and if you are willing to love me  take it and share your girlhood with me  but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not  even then take it  and consider how short lived is beauty. — Plato  Epigram VIInormal Atalanta  also of Greek mythology  raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes  also known as Melanion  a name possibly derived from melon  the Greek word for both  apple  and fruit in general who defeated her by cunning  not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race  so he used three golden apples  gifts of Aphrodite  the goddess of love  to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed  but Hippomenes was finally successful  winning the race and Atalanta s hand. Christian art Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified  popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her. The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in wordplay with the Latin words mālum  an apple  and mălum  an evil each of which is normally written malum. The tree of the forbidden fruit is called  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  in Genesis       and the Latin for  good and evil  is bonum et malum. Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result  in the story of Adam and Eve  the apple became a symbol for knowledge  immortality  temptation  the fall of man into sin  and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the  Adam s apple  because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality  possibly in an ironic vein. Proverb The proverb   An apple a day keeps the doctor away   addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit  has been traced to   th century Wales  where the original phrase was  Eat an apple on going to bed  and you ll keep the doctor from earning his bread . In the   th century and early   th  the phrase evolved to  an apple a day  no doctor to pay  and  an apple a day sends the doctor away   the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in     .What to know about apples Apples contain antioxidants  vitamins  dietary fiber  and a range of other nutrients.

What vitamins are in apples? Apples contain many of the vitamins necessary for healthy body function. Different types of apples will contain different amounts. Generally  apples contain the followingTrusted Source vitamins  vitamin A vitamin C vitamin E They also contain a variety of B vitamins  such asTrusted Source  vitamin B   or thiamine vitamin B   or riboflavin vitamin B   or niacin vitamin B   or pyridoxine vitamin B   or folate Aside from vitamin C  apples only provide small amounts of these vitamins. Some of these vitamins are present in the skin. For the most nutritional benefit  a person should consume the skin as well as the flesh of the apple. Additionally  apples contain very small amounts of different minerals  including  calcium iron potassium magnesium phosphorus sodium zinc manganese Which apple is lowest in sugar? Apples have some amount of natural sugar  which gives them sweetness. The amount of sugar varies with the type of apple. In comparing some of the most popular types of apples  the Granny Smith variety has the lowest sugar and Fuji has the highest sugar. All calculations are grams of sugar per     g of apple  Apples are a valuable part of any diet. They are rich in vitamins  minerals  and fiber  which can help control hunger and regulate blood sugar. Eaten regularly  preferably with the nutrient rich skin on  apples can supplement any diet with important vitamins and minerals. There are very few risks to apples  except for allergies and toxins from eating many apple seeds. There are many varieties of apples. They come with different nutrition profiles but are fairly similar in how much sugar  carbohydrates  and protein they contain.

Lakso and Martin C. Goffinet Department of Horticulture  NYSAES  Cornell University Geneva  NY       The apple fruit goes through a complex developmental sequence over a growing season. Understanding the processes involved  what supports fruit growth and what limits it  helps to support good crop man  agement. This ar  ticle describes the basic processes of fruit growth and the factors that support or limit fruit growth. The apple fruit derives from the base of the apple flower after pollination and fertilization of the egg cells in each of the    ovules in the base of the flower  Figure   . After petal fall the base ovary of the flower begins to expand to make the fruit we harvest  as the diagram shows. Apple growth is properly measured in weight gain. Diam  eter can be measured but since it is only one dimension of a   dimensional fruit  diameter expansion can be deceiving. For example  a   mm increase in diameter very early in the season may represent only part of a gram while near harvest a   mm increase can mean several grams of weight growth. So  we use weight growth in this times  etc. This gives an ever increasing rate of growth. For the first week or so growth is only by cell division as cells do not get bigger  Figure   . Figure  . The inherent seasonal pattern of apple fruit growth by weight with no crop or environmental limitations. Note the initial curvilinear growth for     weeks is by cell division but later linear growth is by cell expansion. Then from about   week after bloom until about   or   weeks after bloom  growth occurs by both cell division and cell expan  sion. Finally  growth for the rest of the season occurs essentially only by cells expanding. During this cell expansion period the fruit adds a similar amount of weight per day until harvest  al  though with very heavy crops or cold weather the rate of fruit growth may decline before harvest. We have found that large fruit have higher growth rates than smaller fruit  for example     discussion. Seasonal Growth Pattern of Apple Growth Once the flower is fertilized  the fruit  let grows initially by exponential cell divi  sion  that is  cells di  vide to produce twice as many cells  then divide again to give   times as many  then   Figurere  . Diagram of the apple flower and how it evolves into a fruit. Drawing by M. Goffinet. NEW YORK FRUIT QUARTERLY . VOLUME    . NUMBER   . SPRING         grams per day versus  .  grams per day respectively . When we measured cell numbers per fruit  we found that the difference in growth rate was directly controlled by cell numbers  as each cell grew the same amount per day in all fruits. Because the apple tree  with a heavy bloom  will produce       times more flowers and potential fruit than desirable at harvest         of the fruits must fall off to avoid over cropping. If too many fruit compete for too long  cell division is curtailed. In a detailed anatomical study we found that fruit size variation at harvest from thinning trials was about     explained by cell numbers and only a small amount due to cell size variation. The bottom line is that the final fruit size potential  and gener  ally the actual size at harvest  depends primarily on the number of cells in the fruit. And since cell numbers are set in only the first few weeks after bloom  that is a critical time for the whole season. Fruit with low cell numbers from excess competition after bloom  due to late or inadequate thinning  can never catch up later to become large fruit. Good fruit size requires a lot of cells. Since cell numbers are a result of cell division that occurs only in the first several weeks after bloom  the critical time to adjust fruit numbers by thinning is as early as possible after bloom. If thinning is done early  the retained fruit will have time for further cell division  thus improv  ing size potential. However  if thinning is done late  the fruit will have suffered from competition for too long  have too few cells and have little to no time to catch up in cell numbers. Additionally  next year’s flower buds are already developing at the same time fruitlets are setting in the weeks after bloom. If thinning is delayed too long  not only is fruit size decreased  but return flowering and next year’s crop potential will be reduced as well. Both these factors place an emphasis on early crop adjust  ment. As fruit grow in weight  the apple fruit accumulates large amounts of starch during the season. We have found that the starch is not available to support fruit growth  but it appears that the starch is saved to be converted to sugars as harvest ap  proaches. Presumably this was a natural selection for making fruits in the wild sweeter and more attractive to animals to in  crease seed dispersal. This change from starch to sugar provides a useful common indicator of fruit maturity. Why Do Some Fruit Drop and Some Stay on the Tree? Since often     or more of the young apple fruitlets need to fall  either naturally or by chemical or hand thinning  we won  dered why some fruits drop but others stay on the tree? It turns out that fruit that can maintain a continuously high growth rate stay on the tree. However  fruit that have a slow growth or slow their growth for several days will drop. We have monitored the growth of thousands of fruit over many years and find a consistent general relationship between fruit growth rate and drop  Figure   . Although varying a bit  it is the same for many varieties as well as for fruit drop caused by different thinners  natural stresses of low light or just excess competition among fruits. A decrease in growth rate that leads to fruit drop can also occur for only a few days  but once it happens the fruit is destined to drop in the next week or so. So the bottom line is that anything that reduces fruit growth will increase drop. That seems to explain why so many different things  stresses  different chemical  cloudy or hot periods  etc.  can increase fruit drop.    Figure  . General relationship between apple fruit drop and growth rate showing that fruit have to retain a high growth rate to be able to stay on the tree.  Fruit Respiration and Mineral Uptake Fruit respiration  that generates energy for growth  is very high early in the season  as cell division requires a lot of energy. As the fruit shifts more in mid and late season to cell expansion that requires less energy  the respiration rates decline. However  apple is what is called a “climacteric” fruit that has a marked increase in respiration and the production of ethylene just at harvest. This indicates a striking change in the metabolism of the apple fruit as it reaches maturity. As well as accumulating carbohydrates and water  the fruit take up mineral nutrients during the season such as nitrogen  po  tassium and calcium that are needed for growth and cell function. Calcium is particularly critical for fruit quality and postharvest storability. Calcium is taken up more rapidly in the first half of the season  during the cell division period. As the fruit grows and a thicker waxy cuticle forms there is progressively less calcium uptake. This means that as the fruit is expanding but taking up less and less calcium  the calcium concentration in the fruit declines as harvest approaches. It has been found that uptake of calcium depends on the spur leaf area associated with the fruit. Again this focuses our attention on the early season activity. Early thinning removes fruit competition and therefore helps calcium uptake of the retained fruit. The take home message is again that the first few weeks after bloom are critical for fruit nutrition also. Good crop management requires early and effective thinning. Support for Fruit Growth The inherent growth pattern of the apple fruit is genetically determined. Fruit growth requires substantial support of carbo  hydrates  water and nutrients  however  it can be limited by lack of these resources. Carbohydrate reserves The initial growth of the shoots and flowers at bud break in the spring is supported by carbohy  drate reserves in the roots and branches. Gradually  as leaves are produced  there is a transition from solely depending on reserves to obtaining greater support from current photosynthesis of the leaves. Several studies have found that the carbohydrate reserves bottom out just about bloom then begin to increase again  indicat  ing that after bloom the fruit are not depending on reserves any NEW YORK STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY  Figure . General diagram of seasonal apple fruit calcium content  amount per fruit  and concentration  of weight  as percent of the seasonal maximum. The decline in concentration over the season is the result of continued fruit growth while Ca uptake gradually decreased. more. Several other studies have shown that after bloom  fruit are almost entirely supported by current tree photosynthesis. Current Photosynthesis. Do all leaves on the tree support the fruit or do some support other competing organs such as shoots and roots? We have done studies to determine which leaves on the trees support fruit development at different times over the season. These and studies of several other labs have clarified the picture. Extension shoot leaves support the growth of the shoot with carbohydrates until at least       leaves have unfolded. After that  the most basal leaves on the shoot can export carbohydrates to the fruit. However  we have found that if the shoot is shaded  then as many as    leaves will send their carbohydrates to the shoot and not to the fruit. Eventually  when extension shoots stop growing  all the leaves can send their carbohydrates to the fruit. That is why very light pruning that gives a large number of shoots that stop growth quite early  will support fruit set and early fruit growth better than heavy heading cuts that give more long  vigorous extension shoots that compete with the fruit for longer times. In the first few critical weeks after bloom the carbohydrate support for fruit growth comes from the spur leaves and small “spur like” leaves on the short lateral shoots off last years stems  not from the extension shoot leaves. This was very clearly seen when we shaded whole trees for   days when the fruit averaged about    mm diameter and then measured how much growth occurred in fruit versus extension shoots  Figure   . Even down to     of full sunlight  shoots continued to grow at the same rate while fruits were reduced to essentially zero. This heavy shade to     of full sun led to complete de fruiting of the trees while having no effect on shoot growth. It appears that under limiting light  the tree puts its limited energy into extending shoots to obtain more light and survive till another year. This is also consistent with     the tree replenishing reserves after bloom even though the tree is supporting young fruitlet growth  and     the mechanism of juvenility for apple seedlings which is the tendency to not flower or set fruit for several years to allow the tree to get established and can support a crop. The general pattern of support for fruit growth after bloom Figure  . The effect of   days of varying light on the growth rate of extension shoots versus apple fruit at about   weeks after bloom  fruit diameter about    mm .  NEW YORK FRUIT QUARTERLY . VOLUME    . NUMBER   . SPRING         Figure . General diagram of the seasonal pattern of which leaves contribute to the support for fruit growth. Note that the extension shoot leaves generally contribute very little to the fruit until about     weeks after bloom.  Figure    is that primary spur leaves  those that come out before bloom  initially are important to support the fruit  but their im  portance gradually declines due to their small leaf area. Next  the leaves on the lateral  “bourse”  shoots in the spur develop after bloom and support the fruit unless they are extremely vigorous. Finally  the leaves on the extension shoots with more than about    leaves begin to support the fruit. Gradually as shoots stop growing  all their leaves can support fruit growth. For the last  /  of the season both bourse leaves and shoot leaves support the fruit. From these studies it seems clear that we need to expose spur canopy of leaves to sun as much as feasible the during the weeks just after bloom since they are the primarily supporting the fruit. Using a laser as an artificial sunbeam  we analyzed what percent  age of the sun was captured by spur leaves versus shoot leaves   weeks post bloom in several orchards. We related the sunlight capture to the yields of those orchards. As expected from the discussion above  we found that      Orchard yields were positively related to sunlight capture by  the spur leaves. This combined the total sunlight capture of the whole orchard and the relative sunlight capture by the spurs versus extension shoots.     Conversely  excessive sunlight capture by extension shoot leaves  by reducing the light available to the spurs in denser canopies  led to lower orchard yields.     By about a month after bloom  all or most shoot leaves can support fruit  the local effects of light seen earlier are much less important. Summary In summary  there are many aspects of apple development that have been learned. Many of the key points are  Fruitsdevelopfromthebaseoftheappleflowerafterpollination and fertilization and the flower walls around the seed cavity expand to become the fruit flesh. Theapplefruitgrowsinitiallybycelldivisionforaboutaweek  then by both cell division and cell expansion for     more weeks  then predominantly by cell expansion. Final potential fruit size depends primarily on cell numbers  which are produced shortly after bloom. So  for good fruit size thinning effectively and early is critical  that is  small fruits at   month after bloom will never make big fruit . Carbohydrate reserves support flower development but are appar  ently not supporting the fruit growth after bloom. Post bloom fruit growth is supported by the current photosyn  thesis of the leaves. Spurs support fruit growth in the first few critical weeks after bloom. Extension shoots do not support fruit initially as they support themselves until a few weeks after bloom. Iflightislimited cloudy etc.  shoot growth seems to have priority and fruit growth and set will suffer if there are too many shoots to support. Yields of apple orchards depend strongly on the sunlight captured by the spurs in the critical weeks after bloom. All of these results emphasize the importance of open canopies to get light to spurs  light pruning to have fewer vigorous shoots  and early thin  ning to allow maximum cell numbers to be produced.
